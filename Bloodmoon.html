<h3>HE HEARS THE WIND IN THE SEDGE</h3>

<blockquote>
  I wander by the edge<br>
  Of this desolate lake<br>
  Where wind cries in the sedge:<br>
  <i>Until the axle break</i><br>
  <i>That keeps the stars in their round,</i><br>
  <i>And hands hurl in the deep</i><br>
  <i>The banners of East and West,</i><br>
  <i>And the girdle of light is unbound,</i><br>
  <i>Your breast will not lie by the breast</i><br>
  <i>Of your beloved in sleep.</i></blockquote>

<h1><a name="before"></a> The Last Days of the
Sun</h1>

<h2><a name="ch01"></a>1. Of Master Aengus &amp; His Love</h2>

<p class="first">THERE IS A LAND that is nearest the moon; and
there in that land was once a fine young lady, bargained her way
into a great manor house, and was the envy of the county by the
banks of the Bride. The lady lived with the old lord of the
manor, and some called her the old lord’s ward, and some
called her his wife.</p>

<p>The lady passed her time in reading, though mostly only
novels, and one most of all, and the spine of it all worn
smooth, the way it was her best-beloved. She took down and
opened this old book one time, and started reading in the
middle. And all at once she pushed the book away and said,
‘Ah, and the like of <i>that</i> will never be happening to
me.’</p>

<p>And there was a poor, proud farmer, loved the fine young
lady. But his love was so cursed that even the wind in the sedge
by the desolate lake would be crying out to him, <i>Never,
never</i>…</p>

<p>‘Let her come back to this place, then!’ Master Aengus
would shout.</p>

<p>But the wind in the sedge cried, <i>Never, never</i>…</p>

<p>So Master Aengus left the lake behind. His fields, his
farmhouse and his milch-cow went untended, and his dog cried
from the post in vain.</p>

<p>He was a strange one, Master Aengus: not the everyday run of
a farmer at all. His hands were long, with knuckles round as
quail’s eggs, and sparse black hairs growing upon the backs,
like reeds bent by the wind. And he had a gap in his right
eyebrow, where a pale scar ran. And there was a lock of white
hair grown out in his dark locks above his left ear.</p>

<p>On the road he passed a stream, and stopped to watch the
millwheel turn. Round and round went the quern, grain before it,
meal behind it. The rain feeding the stream, the stream raising
the millwheel, the millwheel turning the quern, the brown grains
grinding, and all the world against him. Master Aengus left the
mill and miller, and went up on the hill.</p>

<p>Where he sat on an old, broken millstone at the cross-roads,
and waited in the rain. Until the damned day fled, and the
golden green rain dissolved in black mist.</p>

<p>The lady then was dining, and laughing with her friends.</p>

<p>In the night Master Aengus slipped around the village,
climbed the high stone wall, and tracked up the path he knew so
well.</p>

<p>Where he found the rut of seventeen paces, where like a dog
he padded up and down. Until a candle gleamed in the window
above, and a small pale hand unlatched the casement.</p>

<p>She looked out of the casement into the deep night. Then she
looked down and saw him. He was standing in the worn place in
her garden, there where he always stood, with his blushes and
rude ragged hair.</p>

<p>She stood quite still when she saw him. She was afraid of
him. She was afraid most of all of his eyes.</p>

<p>Then Master Aengus said to her:</p>

<p>‘Agatha beloved, make the wind a liar, come down to me here
and delight my heart!’</p>

<p>‘No, Master Aengus, I’ll not do that tonight.’ Lady
Agatha said, and turned behind her fan into her chamber, and
closed the casement. She felt her heart beat very fast.</p>

<p>From her shoulders she let fall her India muslin wrapper, and
she slid with a whisper into pallid golden sheets, and gave
herself to dreams.</p>

<p>In her garden a great slashing stroke cut down a
lady’s-rose in the night. And he stole away, did Master
Aengus, across hay meadows to the wood in the park, the lord’s
preserve. Where he lay against a hazel log, and held the flower
on his breast.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Agony,’ Master Aengus sighed. Her given name was
Agatha, but in his heart he called her Agony, for she was that
to him.</p>

<p>Come first light Master Aengus woke. There was six days’
beard on his cheek, but the lady’s-rose was still wrapped up
tight in itself. And he heard a winding horn, the lord’s horn
calling up the green and golden dawn.</p>

<p>That morning she rose out of bed and bathed and dressed
herself, just as she always did. But that morning it seemed to
her she saw something different about the light, and the shadows
in the corners of her room, and the worn book lurking on the
nightstand by her bed.</p>

<p>She went down to breakfast, and found the others there before
her: ‘Have I been sleeping overlong?’ she asked.</p>

<p>Lady Felicia, her closest friend, laughed and answered,
‘Scarcely that! But it’s a wonder you could have slept, my
dear, through the clatter that went on.’</p>

<p>‘A bit harsh, my dear,’ muttered dear old Sir James.</p>

<p>‘Sir James awoke early, still in the night, really, and
insisted on breakfast straightaway,’ said Dame Letitia.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I was hungry, and fancied a bit of bacon,’ muttered
Sir James. And at that Lady Agatha, Miss Cecily, and even Mr
Humphreys laughed. And even the laughter of her friends struck
Lady Agatha as odd and precious on that morning.</p>

<p>The old lord walked in, came up to Lady Agatha and put his
arm about her waist. He kissed her cheek nicely, taking his
rights of her, and turned to his friends and guests to say,
‘I’ve been up for hours already, while you’ve been laying
abed.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but when weren’t you the first to be rising?’
asked Lady Felicia. ‘Sometimes I wonder if you sleep at
all.’</p>

<p>‘Tonight,’ he answered, ‘was special – and today is
too. Drink and eat heartily, my friends,’ he said, ‘the way
it’s a day for celebrating. Today is Agatha’s birthday, and
she is twenty-one today, and tonight,’ he added, drawing her
closer to him in his long, thin arm, ‘tonight she shall come
into her estate, and her dream will be realized.’ At this all
the gentlemen tapped their glasses and chorused, ‘Bravo!’
and the ladies stepped forward to offer Lady Agatha heartfelt
felicitations, to which she could only reply, blushing happily,
‘I’d forgotten all about it.’</p>

<p>The old lord loosed his grip of her, strode to the doors and
threw them open. ‘Mac Bride! Mac Bride!’ shouted he. The old
countryman appeared in the gravel of the drive, tall, dark, and
waiting.</p>

<p>‘Do you now,’ commanded the old lord, ‘Mac Bride, wake
up the master of the hunt, let the horses be saddled, and
unleash the hounds! By God, we’ll hunt on this fine morning of
the Lady Agatha’s birthday!’</p>

<p>The old countryman bowed and answered, ‘Aye, my lord,’
and vanished to do his master’s bidding.</p>

<p>So the old lord whistled up a hunt, and they went riding in
his park. First went the portly master of the hunt, and followed
the old lord’s guests and friends, the wealthy men and their
well-fed ladies, and the old lord himself on his stallion. </p>

<p>Behind them rode Lady Agatha in a green riding habit, looking
about her and delighting in the fineness of the day. And then
she saw the farmer standing in her way.</p>

<p>She drew up rather than ride him down, and he caught her
reins in his brutal hands with the great round knuckles and the
sparse black hairs.</p>

<p>‘Agatha, now make the wind a liar, come down to me here,
hide me from the world behind the curtain of your hair!’</p>

<p>She laughed: that was nerves and breathlessness. ‘No,
Master Aengus, I’ll not do that today!’</p>

<p>He let go her reins, and she left him standing there. Lady
Agatha spurred her milk-white mare on, flashing through the
trees, faster, faster.</p>

<p>Master Aengus stood watching her. The golden dawn lit up the
half of his face, its bristles and hard lines, and his glittery
cold wise eyes.</p>

<p>He held up his sword, that his father had won at Boyne, where
he had lost all else. ‘If I could only hate you, Lady, and be
free! But it’s the world I hold condemned, for it’s put you
up on a milk-white mare, and left me only a rusted blade.’ </p>

<p>Cursing he put back his father’s sword, and left the
lord’s preserve.</p>

<p>In the blue west a fiery moon was falling: Beltane Moon she
was, and it May Day Eve. Beltane is a favoring fire, the way at
one time the Druids made fires with spells, driving cattle
between them against evil. Master Aengus kissed to the moon a
golden guinea on a chain at his throat. Then he went away.</p>

<p>And it was a day and more than a day, and no man heard tell
of him.</p>

<p>And that night, while the others lay sleeping, Lady Agatha
could not sleep. There was a burning in her breast, and her
thoughts and hopes racing round and round, at all the promises
the lord had made her, and all those he had already fulfilled.
She took a lamp down the hallway, past all the doors of the
bedchambers of their friends and guests, sleeping soundly. At
the sound of Sir James’ trumpetous snore, she smiled.</p>

<p>But in her mind’s eye there flashed the sight of the brutal
hands with the great round knuckles and the sparse black
hairs.</p>

<p>She went into her own room and quietly closed the door. Upon
her pallid golden bed she sat, and picked up her book, and
stroked its smooth spine before she let it fall open on the
counterpane: there on that page she let her finger fall, and
there on that word she began to read: ‘Yes,’ she answered,
‘and let you return to me on the morrow, at this very hour,
Master Aengus. And then – may be! – I’ll go down to
you.’</p>

<p>So she slept, but months went by, and he never came.</p>

<h2><a name="ch02"></a>2. Of the Thing That He Did</h2>

<p class="first">ON SUMMER’S EVE Lady Agatha went riding,
through the long dusk sparkling with bonfires from every hill,
and by chance it was Master Aengus’ farm she was riding past.
His house was fallen in, dwelt in by deer and foxes; his fields
were fallow, his milch-cow gone away, his dog tracked and slain
for taking sheep. But no man, not even a King’s man, would
take over that farm, for the curse that lingered there.</p>

<p>‘It’s a shame,’ said a man, ‘for the land to be
barren and wasting away. Won’t his people come to claim the
place?’</p>

<p>‘You know he hasn’t any people at all,’ said another.
‘Even old Tadgh and Maille May, they only took him in, the way
they weren’t blessed with any children of their own, so they
say. He was a foundling child.’</p>

<p>‘Where,’ she wondered, ‘has he gone to, then?’ She
felt gentleness toward him, now he was gone away forever. For
she felt safe at last from his eyes and from the feelings she
felt underneath the fear, like the feeling the hind must feel
when the hunter tracks her. But the sight of his farm was as if
a cold hand put its fingers down the neck of her. Glad she was
to put that ruin at her back!</p>

<p class="break">AND MASTER AENGUS stood upon a spine of hills,
between Earth and Heaven in the burning, burning night. The rush
of the sea swarmed round him like the wildest blessing, and the
gentle air was thick with it.</p>

<p>And Master Aengus pushed into the air onto the far side of
the hill over the strand. That was how he won through at last,
into the back of beyond, where no mortal men may ever pass. And
the fire in the air swarmed and buzzed around him like a hundred
thousand bees. But Master Aengus pressed on still.</p>

<p>A track of stones led down to a little stone hut. He bent and
beat on the door with his staff.</p>

<p>‘Who’s there?’ was asked.</p>

<p>‘Open to me, now!’ shouted Aengus.</p>

<p>The latch stirred, and the door opened three fingers wide. An
old, old crone peeped out. She was so old her feet might well
have walked the earth before the first grass grew.</p>

<p>Master Aengus smiled a wild smile into that lovely face.
‘Give me the heart of my Lady Agatha and let her yield to me,
or else the peace of death I’ll never see.’</p>

<p>But those words broke the crone’s face into a grin. She
banged the door shut, and her old voice said, ‘Fool Aengus!
D’you think I don’t mind what wind cries in the sedge?’</p>

<p>‘Come out!’ cried Aengus. But his staff and his voice
broke on the stones.</p>

<p>Leaving, he broke a yellow pin-wheel in the garden path. It
was a thing done out of spite. But far away a wave came crashing
on the shore, curling all around the Irish land.</p>

<p class="break">AND LADY AGATHA prospered, to hear the world
tell of it, and gave herself to reading. Still and all, to some
she seemed unsatisfied with all the gold she’d won. Her lord
was kind enough to her, but he loved his hounds and horses every
bit as much; and he was old, with an old man’s ways.</p>

<p>There was never a harvest for promise like that year’s
harvest. It promised fair to be as rich as Lady Agatha, as folk
said, and make truth of the saying that on Bron Trogain, the
start of the harvest, the Earth lay in labor under the grain,
the way <i>bron trogain</i> is the trouble of the Earth.</p>

<p>On the day after Bron Trogain the old lord had a word with
the magistrate, and Master Aengus was outlawed, and the King’s
men rode out on his trail with their white hounds.</p>

<p>And Lady Agatha went to the desolate lake.</p>

<p>She had never gone there, never since the day Master Aengus
had espied her, and she had spoken a thing – no, he couldn’t
have heard her murmur, not clear across the lake.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha let trail the reins and wandered in the sedge.
The red sun of Lammas Eve shone off the waters into her eyes and
it was sad she was, the way the cold was gathering in the upper
airs, and it was nearly summer’s end.</p>

<p class="break">BUT MASTER AENGUS was caged in a hollow tree at
the edge of a wood under a spine of hills, and he with a bit of
meat on the end of his sword to roast over his fire, when one of
the King’s hounds found him. Big it was, sow-white, its ears
red as rowan berries. The baying of the other hounds sounded
from out the mist, and the King’s men close behind.</p>

<p>Master Aengus dipped the bit of meat into the fire, bringing
out the juices, and offered it to the hound. For a moment the
hound was wavering between man and meat; then it set its jaws
about the meat. Master Aengus spitted the dog on his sword, and
ran it through.</p>

<p>The baying of hounds rang off the hills. Master Aengus left
his father’s sword in the hound. Far away in the wood
something glimmered white in the mist. It was a pooka or a hind
a-fleeing into a thicket. Master Aengus followed it.</p>

<p class="break">THAT SAME EVENING Lady Agatha went riding in
the wind and rain, and it was black night before she ventured
back into the manor house, river-wet through cloak and dress and
stockings, pale of face, her hands like knots in the leather
reins. She let her maid undress her, and she warmed herself in
the fire in her chamber, and slipped into her bed to sleep.</p>

<p class="break">INTO A HOLLOW LAND the white thing led Master
Aengus, where the bogs quaked round his feet. The soft rain
feeding his fever, splashing on his brow, shuddering to steam,
until bright laughter stopped him.</p>

<p>A lady with a silver cloak and crown of hair was sitting on a
stone. Her brow was a lily, her eyes were twinkling and her lips
red as bleeding blackberries.</p>

<p>‘Why are you laughing, then?’ asked Master Aengus.</p>

<p>‘Are you not a farmer from the Bride?’ asked the beauty
in her turn. ‘I’ve heard tell of you.’</p>

<p>‘What thing have you heard?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, this and that! That your looks were such, folk took to
calling you Aengus for a jest; that your manner was such, they
called you Master, poor as you were. And that you know many a
difficult and dangerous thing: in short, that you are a free
thinker, and a philosopher.</p>

<p>‘And what has that won you, Master Aengus? Lady Agatha
still blushes when you gape at her. Not all the potions ever
blent will win you what you want!’</p>

<p>‘What then but die?’ asked Aengus.</p>

<p>‘Have you courage? Would you dare all?’</p>

<p>‘I would dare nothing, for nothing’s all to me.’</p>

<p>‘Then you might do something after all. And then the curse
against your love will be ended, and your lady will consent to
love you – or rather, she will conceive for you the strongest
amorous desire. But if you do it, Aengus! Then her longing for
you will be short-lived, and meanwhile all her world will be
ruined and waste!’</p>

<p>The beauty smiled, daring and tempting and urging all at
once.</p>

<p>‘I will do it.’</p>

<p>The beauty pointed with a twig. ‘Go into this hollow. In
your shirt you’ll be shivering, and your throat it will be
dry. It’s Samhain now and the Winter’s Moon, elder than the
Sun. Not all the fire of day can thin the mist on this holy last
night, with Winter wanting to be born.</p>

<p>‘And you will hear a singing down the way, like a
nightingale. Draw near, but make no sound.</p>

<p>‘In an island in the bog you’ll be finding a slender
maiden singing, and she alone and drawing in the mud with a
willow-wand. Little older than a girl she’ll be in her
grass-green coat.</p>

<p>‘Catch her if you can, but if she prove too quick, it’s
with cleverness you must coax her out. Hold on fast, and don’t
be letting go until she promise all you want! She has the
secret, though she will be swearing she doesn’t know it at
all. And if she will not, then tell her, do it for my sake. And
if still she will not, then show her this.’</p>

<p>From her sleeve the beauty drew a small white stone, rounded
and smooth, the size of a hen’s egg.</p>

<p>Master Aengus took the stone, the leag lorgmhar. He went down
the path. The beauty’s silver voice calling after him:</p>

<p>‘She’ll be telling you your love can never be, dark
Aengus. Your love, and your love only in all the world, is so
cursed: and why should that be so? But there is a way. Would you
wake the Unappeasable Host, Aengus? Would you break the Axle,
would you prick the Sun’s blood-red black boil, for one
woman’s sake? Could any man’s love be so mad or
singular?’</p>

<p>Master Aengus went into the hollow. In his shirt he was
shivering, and his throat was dry, just as she said it would be.
It was Samhain and the Winter’s Moon, and not all the fire of
day could thin the mist on that last night, with Winter wanting
to be born.</p>

<p>And then he heard a singing down the way, like a
nightingale.</p>

<p class="break">AGATHA woke up in her golden bed.</p>

<p>Now, that was New Year’s Eve by the cottagers’ calendar,
when all the souls are loosed. In spite of the rain, the land
was brightened by hundreds of bonfires lighting on the hills;
needfires the countryfolk called them, burned to rekindle the
Sun against winter night. Lady Agatha huddled underneath the
pallid golden sheets, hearing a sound of hoofbeats, of a hundred
hundred riders coming forth. And she heard a gentle woman
laughing: and she could not sleep. It was four weeks before the
fever would be leaving her.</p>

<p>The next evening was clear and fine, and the rich men and
their well-fed ladies in the manor house were delighting in the
splendors of the sunset. It was most unseasonably warm.</p>

<p>And in the last moment of the day, a small black speck showed
on the sun’s broad face.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha all at once asked, ‘Whatever became of the
strange lonely farmer was ever chasing me, was Master Aengus not
his name?’ But they didn’t know.</p>

<p>All that night the rich folk lay sleepless in the heat.
Cambric upon cambric and the finest India muslins were let drape
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha was alone. Her lord had gone out to take the
measure of his lands, and his voice calling to his hounds came
from far-off through her window, till it was hidden in the
wind.</p>

<p>And she heard a great wave breaking on the stones of the
Irish land, washing to the Western Sea; and an anguished cry
went with it, from a stricken old woman in a hut beyond the
hill. For the girl had told her tale.</p>

<p>There was a story the cottagers told to make sense of the
word, Samhain, and it was like this. <i>Suain</i> is a
<i>gentle</i> sound, and at Samhain <i>gentle</i> voices
sound.</p>

<p>And Lady Agatha heard a third voice calling; and that was
Aengus’ voice.</p>

<p>She went to the window, but was seeing not a soul. She shut
the window to stop the voice, but the room waxed so warm she had
to open up again. His song went on and on. And the beat of the
riders was everywhere; and Lady Agatha was so forlorn, that she
fell asleep at last.</p>

<p>And Master Aengus’ song went right into her sleep.</p>

<p>She knew now why the riders came. They came for her.</p>

<p class="break">FOR FOUR WEEKS the air waxed warmer.</p>

<p>For four weeks the spot grew bigger on the Sun’s broad
face, like a fat beetle that ate of it.</p>

<p>And every night, the Moon in the sky grew rounder, and
fuller, and nearer by.</p>

<p>For four weeks the days grew shorter. Mist like soot obscured
the sky. Weary and spent, the wealthy men and well-fed ladies
were crying for a good long rest: in all those days and nights,
they had not known sleep, no, not a wink of sleep at all. But
Lady Agatha slept straight through those nights, and the days
too, with a secret smile upon her mouth.</p>

<p>And the twenty-seventh day was brutal and dark.</p>

<p>And in the evening of that day the skies broke clear. And in
the last moment of that day the blood-red blackness swallowed
the Sun’s broad face; and the third wave shattered all the
stony Irish coasts. They both heard it, she and he; but none of
those others did.</p>

<p>Shooting stars rained out of Heaven in the dusk of that day,
and the wealthy slept at last. They slept as they had never
slept before. They slept like dead souls. Oh, but they slept!</p>

<p>And the date of that day was the 28th day of November, in the
year of Our Lord 1757.</p>

<p class="break">BUT THAT NIGHT Lady Agatha did not sleep.</p>

<p>‘Aengus,’ she murmured, waking.</p>

<p>The old lord was standing over her bed. ‘Why do you call
that name?’ he asked. His face was a dreadful mask.</p>

<p>‘Because he’s there below, and it’s his voice I hear
singing out my name,’ she answered gaily.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha stretched out her limbs, and she rose out of bed
in only her shift, and stepped across the room.</p>

<p>She heard the old lord shouting for his steed, and riding
after the Sun.</p>

<p>She lighted a lantern, hot between her hands. She paced about
her golden bed. Tumult was rising in her roselike breasts, and a
hollow in her like the apostate’s regret.</p>

<p>She leaned against the casement, peering into black. There
was a glow lacing the hilltops, as from forty flaming cities.
The pregnant trees murmured with the growing chaos, and the
black air shook, with the elongating Night.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ she cried and sighed at once, ‘Oh, Aengus!’</p>

<p>He stepped from a tree into her light. In the dancing glow
his face gleamed darkly, sweating, as from some toil terrible
and great. She was hearing his song again, and it welling in
her, drowning out her own voice, until she danced to it.</p>

<p>She knew that he had caused these things.</p>

<p>‘Who are you, Master Aengus, and what are you, that you can
summon up the winds, the clouds, and this Night? What are you,
that you dare do such things?’</p>

<p>‘I am yours,’ he answered, and gestured with his hands,
and more winds came, like hot breaths, and she was watching the
gestures he made with his fine and lovely hands.</p>

<p>And she was afraid no more.</p>

<p>The warm night swam in Lady Agatha’s titian hair, her eyes
were dim with passion, sultry desire was roused in her
strawberry lips. Red naked beneath her fine lawn shift she
reached and called to him hoarsely, ‘O my Beloved, my aching
sweet love, come up to me here, clothe me with your kisses and
lie alongside me for the night!’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘for one Night.’</p>

<h1><a name="part1"></a> Part I. <br>
The Rising of the Moon</h1>

<h3>The First Year of Night</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the first year of that Night, the Waking
stayed close about their homes. They never strayed far from
their own front doors.</i></p>

<p><i>What had taken place across the world? Why was it always
Night now, and never Day? It bewildered and befuddled them. They
knew not what to make of it. They did not know what had become
of the Sun. They did not know why they Woke and their lovers,
kin, friends, both High and Low alike, still Slept. They did not
know why the Sleeping could not awakened. And every moon-dark
they thought to their hearts, ‘Surely now the Sun will
rise.’</i></p>

<p><i>But the Sun did not rise.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch03"></a>3. How They Lived After</h2>

<p class="first">‘YES,’ HE ANSWERED, ‘for one Night.’</p>

<p>Darkness and heat blotted out the stars, and Lady Agatha
coiled in the great carved bed with Master Aengus. There was a
brilliance in the south, there was a rain of fire. Thick showers
steamed with the smell of ash. Heavy, hot-breathed clouds
caressed the earth.</p>

<p>Hour after hour it was lasting, long into what should have
been day, until at last the clouds were parting, and a placid
flow of light emerged out of the east, of the second moonrise of
that Night.</p>

<p>Master Aengus took Lady Agatha by the hand, and led her out
of the great carved bed. Fires burned in all the manor’s
hearths, and candles shone on the walls and ceilings. Bright was
that house, and warm. Ceol-sidhe of pipers and harpists was
heard from far-off rooms, while the table was spread with rare
delights, and the bricks glowed ruddy with cheer. She kissed
him, and he smiled. They went back into bed. She was wanting him
still; but was it not a lie?</p>

<p>The Moon rose a third time, and a fourth. But the Sun rose no
more. The Sun had burst into a million bits of fire; the Sun was
gone; the girdle of light was unbound.</p>

<p>The Moon, alone among a million strange stars, lighted new
contours on the old Earth. By bubbling seas, blackened hills,
and shrunken lakes, there was only darkness where light had been
looked for, where the cities all had been.</p>

<p>It was as if an age of man had passed.</p>

<p>The great cities of the world were still. London, Paris,
Vienna, Rome, were that many crags of stone. Their doors were
shut; behind those doors, in sealed, dark chambers, the former
rulers of the world slept on.</p>

<p>Others, the Wakeful, went out of their rooms. They stepped
silently into their Night. Beyond the black outlines of towers
and houses they saw the land beyond, rust red and violet in the
silver light.</p>

<p>What was it had marked them, that they few should wake while
all the rest slept on? There is no telling. Cataclysms render no
accounts. But many of them were children.</p>

<p>The Wakeful left the stone-paved streets behind them, and
went out scattering among the fields and hills, to build what
had never yet been built, and make anew what had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>Now, as to Master Aengus and Lady Agatha, the miraculous had
taken place. His song went on and on and she was happy at his
side. But sure, it was a lie.</p>

<p>Now the first month of the Night ended, and another took its
place. And thirteen Moons went over, till the stars wheeled
round to touch the Samhain mark, when all souls and dreams are
loosed. And for four and twenty hours the Moon did not rise nor
shine.</p>

<h3>The Second Year of Night</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the second year of that Night, the Waking
stopped looking to see the Sun again. They grew to greet the
Night as their own. They gave over their grieving for the loss
of the Sleepers. And they began to wonder, What might they find
in darkness down the road, over the hill, and on the far
shore?</i></p>

<p><i>So they donned their hats and bonnets and they shut their
doors behind them, softly without locking them (for they did not
wish to wake the Sleepers), and they wandered out into the
Night-Land to greet the other Waking.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch04"></a>4. Of the Three Gifts He Made Her</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN SHE STOOD out of bed in icy dark, Lady
Agatha shivered.</p>

<p>His song had stopped. The rooms were still. The tables were
bare. For the first time since the setting of the Sun, she
looked outside the windows. And it was Night.</p>

<p>In the main hall she met Master Aengus. He came holding one
small candle. In the candlelight it was his old dark face again,
bent in on itself.</p>

<p>He reached to take her hand, but she withdrew it.</p>

<p>He bowed and uttered, ‘After you, my lady.’</p>

<p>The Moon rose again, but the bright fires, the ceol-sidhe,
and the magical feast never returned.</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ she said, ‘you don’t think I’ll be
staying here with you?’ And she saddled her mare and rode away
off.</p>

<p>She traveled down the King’s road. Out of the sky a chill
was falling, and a bit of snow, but out of the ground warmth was
rising, from deep out of the sun-burned earth, and the
snowflakes melted in midair. The stones and hills, all charred
and singed as they were, gave back the warmth of the fallen Sun.
And a soft whisper was singing in the wind, like a sigh or like
the sea. She could almost make out the voice of that whisper,
but its words were too faint or strange.</p>

<p>On either side of the road the Night-Land spread darkly in
the Moon. The fields were untenanted and still, the hedges black
tangles, the streams sullen silver strands. She passed some
carts along the way, emptied and forsaken. The dray ponies had
slipped their yokes and gone off to places unknown.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha shivered.</p>

<p>‘This isn’t my land at all,’ she wondered. ‘Where is
my home?’</p>

<p>She stopped at a public house, feeling hungry, but the
windows of the place were dark and the chimney cold. The
landlord was sleeping, and the enchantment of his sleep locked
the door fast to all hands.</p>

<p>She saw a few figures alone on the grass fields, and they
dark and twisted, and their gambols unpleasant and odd. She
avoided them, and held to the King’s road.</p>

<p>After some hours, the road led her up a slope and over a
hill, and she saw a great house down the way. The house had a
familiar look, and lights were gleaming in some of its windows,
and so she rode down towards it, until she drew her mare up
short. She stared at the great house.</p>

<p>It was indeed a house she knew. It was the old lord’s manor
house she had left behind her hours before.</p>

<p>She turned her mare, crossed to the far side of the road, and
passed through the hedge into the fields.</p>

<p>She was following the swale of a valley for a time, along a
little nameless stream, until the stream took a turn, and she
saw a great house on a hill. Lights were gleaming in some of its
windows, and it was the old lord’s manor house in her way
again.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha turned her mare about, and plunged into a wood.
She was wending her way through the wood, and coming out the far
side, and seeing a great house beyond the trees.</p>

<p>It was her manor house again.</p>

<p>‘Och!’ she cried in anger, and spun her mare back into
the wood.</p>

<p>Which she traversed, and came out again by another side, and
another again; but whatever the side of the wood she was coming
out of, it was always the old lord’s manor house waiting up
the way, and himself, Master Aengus, quietly abiding within,
smoking his pipe no doubt and telling off the hours until she
came back to him.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha threw herself down on the grass beside her mare
in a little clearing in the middle of the deep dark wood, and
wrapping herself in her silver riding cloak, she made herself
sleep. The Moon rose up over the tops of the trees and shed an
oval of light on her.</p>

<p>After a time she woke, and looked about. She was lying in the
oval drive, and the manor house was sprung up around her with
all its walls and windows.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha fetched a sigh, stabled her mare, and went into
the house.</p>

<p>She heard him smoking in the hall, but she went up the stairs
to her own room and closed the door.</p>

<p>The other bedchambers were all shut fast. At moonrise Lady
Agatha made a tour of the hallways, going from door to door. She
missed Lady Felicia and Sir James, and prayed that somehow they
might waken to her knocking and rescue her. No door was locked;
but no door would open.</p>

<p>‘They’re sleeping yet, Miss’ said the old countryman,
Mac Bride. ‘It wouldn’t be right to be bothering them.’</p>

<p>Next moonrise Lady Agatha tried the doors again.</p>

<p>The old lord did not return. Mac Bride stayed on to serve
Master Aengus. A few cottagers still waked in the village. Not
many.</p>

<p>That moon Master Aengus lingered at her side. He was the
tenderest, humblest, most solicitous of jailers.</p>

<p>He chose her dresses and helped pin her hair. Then she looked
less like herself and more like his vision of her: sad, elegant,
dangerous. Her melancholy seemed only to increase his desire. He
sat and spoke to her of his philosophy, of arcane, erudite
things. She sat obediently by his side. At length, before he had
done, she left the room.</p>

<p>When next the Moon rose, a cool and shivering image on the
waters, Master Aengus went to hunt. Having no powder, he hunted
with lures and his grandfather’s long bow. When he returned,
he cooked potatoes and turnips, carrots and cold carcasses over
turf fires in the kitchens. He ate his stew out of gleaming
copper bowls, with sterling forks, at the lord’s long table.
Lady Agatha ate in her room.</p>

<p>‘Come,’ he said to her, ‘and let’s have a game.’</p>

<p>So she played him at chess. Now Master Aengus would be
winning; now Lady Agatha. Each strove silently, with a great
will, to win.</p>

<p>And all the while their bodies, bending together over the
table, were speaking to each other. And when the king had
fallen, Master Aengus touched her hand, softly, and Lady Agatha
let her fingers trail across his bared wrist, delicately, so
that her touch was no heavier than an hare’s breath; and the
end of it was always the same, they two lying in bed together,
in the great carved bed the lord had let build especially: and
they two still wordless but for their little moans and cries.</p>

<p>To deny it ran past all her powers, for the strength of his
spells lay still upon her. It was her body loving it, and never
herself at all. So she swore it was so in her heart, and would
hear of nothing else.</p>

<p>But when it was done, she gathered her clothes over her bare
body, blushing, and she fled to her own room and her own bed to
rest. He watched her go with his eyes. And so in the dark of the
moon, they rested unsleeping and dreaming apart.</p>

<p>‘Why can’t I leave?’ she demanded.</p>

<p>‘There’s nowhere else for you to find welcome,’ he
answered.</p>

<p>‘Am I your prisoner, now?’</p>

<p>‘No, but I’m yours.’</p>

<p>‘Then let me go!’</p>

<p>But all he did was smile and shake his head; and ‘I love
you,’ he told her – and she flinched.</p>

<p>‘Once it was, you were kinder to me than that.’</p>

<p>He looked at her, at her reproachful eyes. There was a
question in his eyes. He did not ask it.</p>

<p>‘You miss the colors of the day,’ he said. ‘You’re
wrong. The colors of Night surpass them. Wait, and I’ll be
bringing them to you.’</p>

<p>For two moons and a darkness in the attic he worked, and
brought her down a bolt of cloth. And it was white, that cloth,
and brighter than white. White as the stars, white as snow upon
the lofty places in the cold. No fold nor wrinkle might be seen
in all that bolt, but only white, and white.</p>

<p>For a moment, Lady Agatha’s eye brightened at the beauty of
it; then the lost look came back into her face. He left the
cloth in her room, and every moon she was looking on it, but she
never would touch it.</p>

<p>The old man, Mac Bride, was tending to the house. He hadn’t
time to see about the grounds, and they slowly growing wild.
Lady Agatha was passing many an hour with him. She spoke his
name as the cottagers had, ‘Mac Bridey,’ and ‘Mac
Birdie.’</p>

<p>As a man Mac Bride had been summoned to the manor to attend
the old lord’s birth. It was a custom to foster a rich man’s
son on a countryman. The child was sent to stay with his foster
family until his seventh year. The odd thing about this
fostering was that it was Mac Bride had come to the manor. He
had been there ever since. He became the old lord’s godfather,
and it was said the child’s luck resided in his godfather.</p>

<p>‘You served him for so long,’ said Lady Agatha. ‘How
can you serve this one now, who took his place and came into our
house as if he were the lord? Do you not condemn him all to
Hell?’</p>

<p>He answered, ‘I served Aengus once before. Now I’m
serving him again.’</p>

<p>‘You’re waiting for our lord’s return, and watching for
your chance,’ said Lady Agatha.</p>

<p>‘No, it’s not that I’m doing now,’ answered the old
man.</p>

<p>It snowed now and again, lightly melting on the sun-burned
ground. In spite of the snow the airs were mild, and the snows
were melting as soon as ever they fell, and mist rising out of
the fields, warm and sticking on the skin. They called it the
Fire-Warm Winter, they that woke in it. For though Heaven spun
cold where the bright Moon rode, the ground underfoot was as
warm to the touch as the floor-bricks of a hearth, and the lough
waters were warm, and the Sea was warm as well. It was as though
a secret fire burned on deep in the dark soft bosom of the
Earth.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha stole out across the dying lawns to a dale where
the rill of a spring made the mud black, and a broken tree
attacked the stars. She sat buried in the huge bearskin her lord
gave her when he wooed her.</p>

<p>But Master Aengus left the empty house, and he went to the
dark valley. He knew where to go.</p>

<p>She knew him first by the one white lock on his left temple,
and crouched down in the bearskin, hoping he would not see her.
But he did.</p>

<p>No words of greeting passed between them. Master Aengus
pulled the jeweled pins from the veil spun round her eyes; and
he kissed her dark and enigmatic hair. And he caught Lady Agatha
by the waist, and the bearskin fell open on the mud, baring her
body, milky as the moon, baring her breasts, delicate as the
caps of mushrooms quivering in moonlight. Her back he was
pressing against the rough tree bark, so that it was like to cut
her.</p>

<p>‘You are so beautiful,’ he said, and she cringed.</p>

<p>The same question was in his brow, but he told her only,
‘There are other colors of the Night.’</p>

<p>For two moons and a darkness more he worked in his attic, and
brought her down a second bolt.</p>

<p>Red was that cloth, all but unseeable, sensible rather by the
touch. The red of blushing or of tears, of nudity, of the
bedrock still glowing, secret and rebellious, from the
blood-dark fires of the fallen Sun.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha reached for the cloth, and it was bleeding its
warmth into the palm of her hand. But she let her hand fall, and
she turned away.</p>

<p>Master Aengus had a pet in that house, a long-haired cat,
white with a small face and dark blue eyes. She was ever
following at his heels, mewing after him. After every dinner
Master Aengus would be having the cat on his lap, combing the
snarls out of her fur, so that her purring droned in the hall.
Lady Agatha disliked that cat.</p>

<p>Lonely she was, except for Mac Bride. She missed her friends
dearly, and Lady Felicia especially.</p>

<p>When the Moon rose, she saw the countryman walking down the
drive, and she put on her cloak and followed after him. She was
walking as fast as she might to catch up, but the countryman’s
legs were long, and they were on the far side of the village
before she caught sight of him. She was on the point of calling
him to stop and wait for her, when she saw that he was following
the crooked lane up to Master Aengus’ ruined farm. Then she
bit back her call, and went after him quietly.</p>

<p>At the end of the lane she looked out around the hedge, and
saw Mac Bride.</p>

<p>The old man was walking round the ruins of Master Aengus’
farmhouse, withershins west to east and south to north, and
muttering something every time he passed the broken gate. She
was straining her ears to grasp at his words, but this is all
the sense she could make out of them, though she heard them
three times over, once each time the old countryman passed the
gate:</p>

<p>‘Sleep now and stay sleeping, the way we’ve no need at
all for you to be slipping your spoon into our porridge
again.’</p>

<p>After the third time he said these words, if those were
indeed the words that he said, the old man locked the gate,
looked sternly at the ruins, and turned back. She was only just
able to conceal herself in the hedge as he passed.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha crept out after Mac Bride had passed, and walked
up to the ruined farmhouse. She stopped at the gate, and was
looking a long time, and all the same she could see nothing
stirring there, and wondered what it could have been the old man
had been addressing.</p>

<p>‘What is Master Aengus, Mac Bride?’ she asked, when next
she saw him. ‘What kind of a thing is he, the way he could do
all he did?’</p>

<p>‘He calls himself,’ he answered, ‘a man.’</p>

<p>‘Well, but what was he like as a boy? Mac Bride, you know
all the secrets of the county, tell me his.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, he wasn’t the best-loved boy, Miss! He studied and
read, and was the oldest child you could think of. Not a bit
like his brother, now,’ he mused.</p>

<p>‘A brother!’ she said. ‘I never heard he had a
brother!’</p>

<p>‘Och, yes, and a fine scamp of a lad he was.’</p>

<p>‘Whatever became of him? Surely he wasn’t living in the
county these past three years.’</p>

<p>The old countryman seemed out of sorts at the question, and
not disposed to answer. All he would say was, ‘That the tale
of it was he fought the English, and was outlawed: skipped away
across the sea one jump ahead of the hangman, and passed into
the kingdom of France.’</p>

<p>They were quiet for a time. She was waiting to see if the old
countryman would say more; but he could hold his tongue, could
old Mac Bride. Then she asked him that question she had never
dared before:</p>

<p>‘What became of our lord then, in the evening of the last
day when he rode away?’</p>

<p>The old man put down the turf-bundle beside the hearth. The
sods Mac Bride gathered were the finest sort, the way he knew
the best places to be getting them. He let the white cat rub her
chin against his fingertip.</p>

<p>At length he said, ‘When the heat rose, and the clouds
seemed like they caught fire, your old lord took it ill. It was
the look of him, like a man dreading something for a long while,
and finally sure it will not come: then it comes.</p>

<p>‘&nbsp;“Mac Bride,” he calls, running from the house,
“Saddle my horse, there’s quick work to be done!” I
brought him the horse, the earth-colored one. Sure, it was a
younger man’s steed, and he too old and weak to master him;
but he was ever the one to fight against the truth of
himself.</p>

<p>‘Round the house he rode, gun in hand, searching every
shadow. He went up on the hills, and I following after, I cannot
tell you why. The wind is fierce and hot in my eyes, and his
horse’s tail is shaking wild as flames, and the white of its
eyes gleaming in the sooty dusk. He spins the horse round with a
curse, but the thing is done in a moment: a great fire ball
swoops out of the sky and strikes him in a blaze. There was only
the stallion left, burnt bloody dead, and of your lord’s body
nary a sign.’</p>

<p>‘Och, why did you never tell me this before?’</p>

<p>‘Sure, you never asked before.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha blushed. She had not dared to ask before, for the
joy in her had blent together those last hours; she thought she
had not heard her lord ride out until she lay in Master
Aengus’ arms.</p>

<p class="break">MASTER AENGUS left all the keys to the house
with Lady Agatha: all, that is, but one.</p>

<p>‘What’s mine is yours,’ he was telling her. ‘Only do
not go into that room.’</p>

<p>He took her into the attic, and pointed out the door to her.
Then he went and locked himself into that room. It was where he
studied. It was where he made the cloths. She went into the yard
below and gazed up at the room’s one window, and it round, and
seeming broken by the Moon.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha said to Mac Bride, ‘Mac Bride, be opening now
the door to the room in the attic, for I would go in
there.’</p>

<p>But Mac Bride shook his head and answered, That the master
had left her all the keys, and Mac Bride none, so he couldn’t
let her in.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>Neither Master Aengus nor Mac Bride knew she had her own
keys, from the time before the Night. And when Master Aengus was
gone away hunting, she went up the stairs, locking all the doors
behind her. At the top of the stairs lay the white cat. Lady
Agatha took the cat by her collar and sent her down the stairs;
the cat mewed, but she went.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha crossed the attic to the little locked door.
Every key of hers she tried upon that lock, and at the last, the
smallest and darkest of the bunch, the lock turned.</p>

<p>And in she went.</p>

<p>There was moonlight glinting off the broken glass, and there
was her candle gleaming.</p>

<p>On a little table beneath the window were a stone cup of
wine, an inkwell, a bundle of quills and a small jeweled
snuffbox. </p>

<p>On either side the walls were bending in with shelves of old
books, and great cracking parchments curled inside leather bags.
One parchment lay open on the table, held at one edge by a small
white stone, smooth and rounded as a hen’s egg.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha drank the wine in the cup, the way seeing it
reminded her of how thirsty she was. She looked on the
parchment, but she could make no sense of it. The charactery,
all crabbed and bent, looked as though the quill had been
slashing and tormenting the flesh of the parchment. She took out
another parchment, but could read that one no better. She
fetched her down a third, and another still: And the last one
she could read.</p>

<p>By this wisdom he trapped me, she thought. I will read it
too.</p>

<p>She tried the jeweled snuffbox, but could not open it.</p>

<p>She was closing the door behind her, when her eyes fell on
the stone cup. It was full of wine again, though she hadn’t
filled it. She smiled and thought ‘Good, now! He won’t be
missing it!’</p>

<p>Coming down again, she saw a small black spot in the hollow
of her hand. Some soot or ink on the doorlatch must have rubbed
off on her palm. She tried to clean it, but the spot remained,
like a plague spot. She kept it out of Master Aengus’ eyes,
and went on visiting the room all the same.</p>

<p>And she found at last the Smaragdine Table etched upon a
yellowing parchment. And she studied that book as though all her
life hung by it, and it held her faster than novels.</p>

<p>She was eating with him now, he at his end of the table, she
at hers. She ate her stew piping hot, clanging her spoon in the
copper bowl. And she chose her prettiest dresses, and wore
fragrance in her hair and cachets in her bosom. It pleased her,
the way she knew she was breaking his pishogue spell. She felt
his eyes burn after her, and was glad.</p>

<p>And it was many a moon since she had last gone into his bed.
How he was wanting it! But Lady Agatha was free again. So free
she snared herself.</p>

<p>It happened in the darkness, when the Moon was hid. Lady
Agatha was in her room, bathed in the light of nine candles. In
the light his bolt of red cloth caught her eye.</p>

<p>And she held it over her, letting its touch cascade down her
body. She looked at herself in the glass. What a daring dress
that cloth would make! She did off her dress and regarded
herself proudly, naked in her shift and that sheet of flame. It
was like hot breath on her and hot wine within her.</p>

<p>Aengus, she knew, was resting in his room. She had never
watched him dreaming. Setting down the cloth with care, she took
a candle and stepped into the hall.</p>

<p>Soft as smoke she passed the bedchamber doors shut fast on
the sleeping lords and ladies. Until she reached the hall’s
end, and the great groaning door of the lord’s room. For a
moment she paused, and the wanting to go in was like a tongue of
flame tickling the insides of her.</p>

<p>She thought of him lying alone in the great carved bed. But
was he dreaming, now? Perhaps he was thinking on her and wanting
her. Was he staring at this same door – laughing perhaps, in
that proud silent way of his? Did he know she was standing
there, her hand touching this cold brass latch? Was this only
his spell after all?</p>

<p>She shuddered. And she fled down the hall and down the
stairs, out into the quenching Night.</p>

<p class="break">LADY AGATHA was walking steadfastly, with no
thought but to be going, as quickly and quietly as she could,
and be never coming back again. From the upper window in the
manor she appeared a straw doll in her shift. Round about her
the long darkness rolled away, away.</p>

<p>A little cold light soon appeared in the southeast, from the
rising moon. The hills and fields wakened strangely gentle to
her light. Stark warm it was, being Oimell, the starting of
Spring. The cottagers had said that <i>oi</i> is a name for
sheep, and that is when sheep would come and be milked.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha had surely trod this same path a hundred times
during the day, but she hardly knew it now. The world of Night
was nothing like the day. This was his world. He’d made it for
her prison, to trap her in her need.</p>

<p>She slowed her pace. Panic snatched at her. Where was she to
go in this Night-Land of his? Where in this darkness might she
be free of him?</p>

<p>The fear was not leaving her until she bent her knee. The
auburn rings of her hair fell about her eyes, and her fingers
curled through the short, stiff grass burned in their bones like
ice.</p>

<p>She saw in the hollow of her hand a small black spot.</p>

<p>She looked up, and beheld the manor before her.</p>

<p>She sighed, stood up, and walked in.</p>

<p>The house was watchful, dark, and still. The candles had
guttered and died in her room, clouding it with the perfume of
their deaths. The acrid odor harried her.</p>

<p>Lonely she was, and lonely she stayed, all alone in his
Night-Land.</p>

<p>She shut her door and locked it. Soon he would be rising, and
might knock at her door. Weak and wearied, she slid into bed
between the ice cold sheets. She ran her hands lightly over her
curled-up legs, her arms, and her trembling body, hugging
herself, kissing her knees. She was colder than the sheets, cold
as a dead girl fished from a pond. She felt hopeless and
spent.</p>

<p>Sounds reached her from below. He was waking and eating. Soon
she heard the door open and close, and steps on the stones.
There were two sets of them – his and Mac Bride’s. They were
going out hunting, making a noise of it – did they think to
mock her now?</p>

<p>Weak as she was, Lady Agatha went to the kitchen, heated
water, and hauled it up to her room. She set the pitcher down
beneath her window, where moonlight danced in the bath, rippling
round the room.</p>

<p>Before yielding to the steaming waters, Lady Agatha saw
herself in the glass.</p>

<p>She saw her silver, slender legs, her thin shoulders, her
shadowy hair, and the spiral of her back, clear now of those
marks of the tree-bark.</p>

<p>But the black spot on her palm still marked her, and the
other mark, the shameful one he had put upon her, that was there
still: a small red star like the marks the tattooed sailors
wore, and it seeming to say, This one, she belongs to Master
Aengus.</p>

<p class="break">FOR A LONG WHILE Lady Agatha was alone in the
house. Beltane came and Winter’s end; Lughnasadh came and the
harvest start, when handfasting weddings were commonly made, and
still she abode in the manor house alone.</p>

<p>Then Master Aengus came back alone to her. There was blood on
his breeches.</p>

<p>‘I need you,’ he said, and she hated him for it.</p>

<p>And he drew from his bag his seven Moons’ work, a third
bolt of cloth, and the last. And it was black.</p>

<p>Black of the skies behind the stars, of the hills in
rainstorms when the moon is hid below ground. Black of great
age, of hidden places, secret thoughts, untold things. The
blackness in the belly of a woman when first she puts her hand
there, and feels a certain stirring.</p>

<p>And that cloth Lady Agatha took from him. She was looking
down in it as if gazing in a deep, deep well.</p>

<p>He took her to bed, and she let him. She hadn’t the
strength to fight. It was like breathing again after having her
face held under water.</p>

<p>When he loosed her she thought, I cannot stay here in his bed
like this. But somehow she might not go, and fell into dreaming
at his side.</p>

<p>She dreamed she was crawling through a wood, bending under
brambles, and the thorns catching and tearing her clothes, and
she calling, ‘Aengus! Aengus! Come down to me here!’ In the
dream she could not hold back her tears, and the pillows were
wet with them.</p>

<p>Master Aengus sat over her, watching. When she woke it was
his face she saw first. There was wariness in his eyes. A bit of
anger, too. At last he asked her, that question he had not asked
before:</p>

<p>‘What then do you want of me?’</p>

<p>She answered through her tears, defiantly, ‘If you loved me
you would know. O, you should know!’</p>

<p>‘I know. But I’ll not give it to you unless you
ask.’</p>

<p>She shook her head on the pillow. She wanted that last of
all, to be asking him for anything. She bit her lip to hold back
the words. But at last, ere the Moon rose, she said:</p>

<p>‘Bring back the Sun, bring back the world of day
again!’</p>

<p>‘You will rue it,’ said Master Aengus. ‘It is here and
now that we will find our only happiness.’ But he no more than
she would ask for any kindness now.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha went on looking at him, unspeaking, the way she
didn’t dare speak.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Aengus.</p>

<p>And for the second time that Night the stars touched the
Samhain mark, when all souls and dreams are loosed. And for four
and twenty hours the Moon did not rise nor shine.</p>

<h3>The Third Year of Night</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the third year of that Night, the Waking
in their wanderings felt drawn to certain spots.</i></p>

<p><i>Hilltops and glens and bends in the river, inlets on the
coasts, some islands, ancient ruins in the wild, forest
thickets, tall bare outlooks over the great cities. There was
something about those spots, something nameless and beyond
describing in any words from the Day, that in breathed the Night
more fully than the other places in the world. They called these
the Strong Places.</i></p>

<p><i>There the Waking felt as if they had come home again to
places they had never known before.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch05"></a>5. Of Agatha by Moonlight</h2>

<p class="first">MASTER AENGUS made ready to go.</p>

<p>He emptied the attic room, packed his parchments in a bag and
bound it to his horse. The old countryman was helping him.</p>

<p>‘Will you be wanting me along?’ Mac Bride asked.</p>

<p>Master Aengus shook his head. ‘Alone I did the thing, and
alone I’ll be undoing it.’ He looked back to the manor, to
Lady Agatha standing in the doorway. ‘You’ll look after
her?’</p>

<p>‘So long as she’ll be staying here,’ said Mac Bride.</p>

<p>Master Aengus walked toward the house. Lady Agatha was
wearing a robe of blue Pekin Muslin, and in her hair three green
feathers.</p>

<p>‘I am going now,’ he said. ‘It is a far road I must be
taking, if I am to do your bidding.’</p>

<p>‘Go then,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Come with me.’</p>

<p>‘And find this house ever in my path?’</p>

<p>‘I take off that blessing. You may put this manor at your
back and never see her more, if that should be your pleasure.
Only come along with me.’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>Deep in his eyes anger was lashing, like a storm far off the
coast. ‘You want me to betray the Night? It’s my mother
land. And why should I turn traitor for your asking of it?’</p>

<p>‘Do it,’ she said.</p>

<p>Master Aengus nodded, all quiet and still and terrible.</p>

<p>‘You knew nothing,’ he told her, ‘of living ere we met.
It was only the way you’d been taught you were following. I
did know how to live, but my life lacked an end. You became that
end. I’d have done anything for you. I did do what no other
would have, to win you.’</p>

<p>‘Well you may say it,’ said she, ‘but what did you have
in our former life? You lost nothing when the Sun declined:
myself, I lost all. You wagered the world, which was none of
yours, for some hours of my love. But even those hours were only
a trick you played on me. It was never myself who wept for you,
but only a doll you made in my likeness.</p>

<p>‘What did you win then, but my body’s love, and that
spell-wrought and untrue. It was only this end of yours that you
were seeking, and never myself at all. So you made me your
wh—; did you think I’d be loving you for that? Did you dream
you’d find a lawful <i>wife</i> in what you’d made of
me?’</p>

<p>Now there was but sadness and wisdom in his look. As for Lady
Agatha, she felt almost a softening for him, watching the man
trudge back to his horse. But when he mounted, his mare reared,
and Master Aengus turning her, called back in a dark voice,</p>

<p>‘Love is desire, desire is love! A <i>wife</i>, do you say
now? Were you <i>his</i> wife any more? But myself, I’d no bit
of a need for a <i>wife!</i>’</p>

<p>‘May you,’ she shouted after him, ‘be damned all to
Hell, Master Aengus! May you be blasted and waste, for what you
did to me!’ Tears blinding her eyes like veils, and she
swinging the door with a bang against him on his dark mare
riding off.</p>

<p>The young moon was high above the fields, when Master Aengus
went away. And she was the Beltane Moon.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the manor seemed colder and darker, as
though it had been only Aengus had kept alive the last bit of
warmth and cheer.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha ate with Mac Bride in a side room. She was almost
chattering, speaking of Lady Felicia, Miss Cecily, and dear old
Sir James, but not a word did she say of Aengus. The old
countryman watched her, waiting as it seemed.</p>

<p>‘And you, Mac Birdie?’ she asked him. ‘Did you leave no
family behind you in the day?’</p>

<p>The old man shrugged and answered, ‘I had a daughter
once.’</p>

<p>Now this surprised her, to be thinking of Mac Bride, old as
he was and a fixture belonging to the manor, as a man and a
lover and a father to a girl. In the years she had been growing
up in the county, Lady Agatha had seen and heard tell nothing of
a wife or a daughter to Mac Bride, and she had to be asking,
‘What became of her?’</p>

<p>He put down his spoon and wiped his mouth, and she thought he
hadn’t heard her, when he looked up at her and answered,
softly, ‘She was a wayward girl. As wayward as yourself.’
And it seemed that subject was closed.</p>

<p>‘Mac Bride,’ she said, ‘will you do me a favor?’</p>

<p>‘Sure, and name it.’</p>

<p>‘Tend to the house. See that no rogues despoil her.’</p>

<p>‘Would you be going, then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and before the world is any older. I’ll not be
staying, and waiting like a wife for him! But you must stay, Mac
Bride, and guard the lords and ladies sleeping.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ he answered, ‘I’ll not do that.’</p>

<p>‘What, Mac Bride! You lived here all your life, and
you’ll not even see to the place?’</p>

<p>‘I had a life before this place. And it was never the house
I came to serve.’</p>

<p>‘Stay for your lord, then. He may return some day.’</p>

<p>‘No, that one will not be coming back, the way he is gone
out of life.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what of Master Aengus? He’ll be returning at all
odds.’</p>

<p>‘When the master returns to this house, it will mark the
hour of his death,’ answered Mac Bride.</p>

<p>She peered at him, at his face as rough and plain as a
lichenous stone. ‘What are you then, Mac Bride?’ she
wondered in her heart.</p>

<p>He nodded, as though he was divining her very thought.</p>

<p>‘The Sleepers will be well enough, Miss. The enchantment
shutting their doors will seep through all the house after we
two have gone, until in the end it will be at some cost that any
of us three will be able to open the front door; and for anyone
else it shan’t be done at all. No thieves will be harming
them.’</p>

<p>‘Will they never waken? Is it a tomb we’re dining
in?’</p>

<p>‘They will waken surely, if—’ He stopped.</p>

<p>‘—If Master Aengus succeed, and call back the day.’ It
was a truth she had already known.</p>

<p class="break">SHE HAD an odd dream on that dark of the moon.
In the dream she met a woman on the road. ‘Mary bless you, and
where are you for?’</p>

<p>‘I’m meeting my darling,’ answered the woman in her
dream. ‘We’re bound for the abbey. And you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p>‘Have you no sweetheart, now?’</p>

<p>‘I did have, once,’ answered Lady Agatha in her dream,
knowing what a lie that was.</p>

<p>‘Then quick find another! And Mary bless you, indeed!’
And laughing the woman rode away.</p>

<p class="break">CLOTHED in her finest traveling-dress, Lady
Agatha offered Mac Bride farewell and blessings before taking to
the road. She carried with her some dresses and things, and her
beloved book. So she mounted her mare and was off.</p>

<p>She rode down the lane, down to the somber village and its
houses closed with sleep. She forded the Bride on horseback,
swimming against the slick, dark stream. She cut across Squire
Kimball’s fields, the path she always followed to the King’s
road.</p>

<p>And this time she won free of the house, truly. Aengus’
saying proved true. The road did not bend back upon itself. The
manor did not swing back into her way. And for a time she was
breathing lightly in the turnings of the road. Then she
straightened her back and rode faster; and the summer air behind
her scattered her bright laugh.</p>

<p>The air was mild as milk, and she hot in her dress, so she
rode for a darkness and a moon naked in her shift, that was pale
with rippling like the waves curling in to shore.</p>

<p>And it was a wonderful delight she was feeling rising up in
her. She was free of him, free of that house! The vast Night
seemed to be welcoming her. The darkness, hiding so much from
sight, seemed quick with promise, and all the land seemed
gentle.</p>

<p>She was alone now, and must be depending entirely upon her
wit and talents to be making her way; but she was sure she would
be finding all she would be wanting at the end of the King’s
road, in Dublin. There in the great city would be the most
people, people of the Day.</p>

<p>She saw the city from afar, waiting to welcome her, and she
rode quick to meet it.</p>

<p>But Dublin in the Night was a ruinous place.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha rode the empty streets in darkness, and the ache
of it deepening in her breast, the way she had known such
delights in that city, once upon a time. And now the place was
like a quarry pit dug poor beneath the stars.</p>

<p>Its chimneys breathed no more cheerful coal smoke, its
windows all were black, its streets shone oily and slick.
Somewhere behind the stones ten thousand souls lay sleeping,
walled in by their dreams. But in the quiet, moonlit darkness,
they were no better than dead; and the city a place out of Egypt
or Sodom, cursed by God, shunned and haunted.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha shivered and shook. She rode those forsaken
streets no more than an hour, before the dread and the horror of
it drove her out into the countryside.</p>

<p>Then the darkness did not seem so kindly to her, but
forbidding and mean-hearted. Instead of the friendly green of
grasses, blue of sky, and gold of haystacks, she was seeing
nothing but black lands and white ribbons of streams, and red,
caught in glimmers at the edge of things, like the deep burning
of rage.</p>

<p>Along the way she ate off the trees and briars of black
Ireland. The fruit, ripened in the moonlight, had a different
taste. She was finding it bitter.</p>

<p>Waste it seemed to her, and every village forsaken and lone,
until she saw a ruddy brightness on a hill.</p>

<p>She rode up the hill, and found a child burning planks and
twigs in the middle of a crossroads.</p>

<p>‘What are you doing now, child?’ she asked.</p>

<p>The child looked at her, put a finger up along its cheek and
answered, ‘Wait. They’ll be coming.’</p>

<p>She tethered her mare at a bush by the way and let her graze.
And after a time other children were coming, bearing bundles of
twigs and logs and many other things, and casting them onto the
pile. And soon the needfire mounted halfway up the sky, roaring
and reddening the hill.</p>

<p>‘What are you burning?’ she asked the child.</p>

<p>‘Whatever we want,’ it answered, and danced around the
fire.</p>

<p>More of them came, curious folk, boys and girls and bent old
folk, and many tongues were spoken among them, though there
seemed no lack of understanding. Only the very young and the
very old were there, children and grandfolks, and no parents.
They wore the dress of different lands; some were fair and some
were dark, and some dressed in fineries and some in rags. But
there was a robber’s look and a gleam in the eye of all of
them, so they seemed all kindred.</p>

<p>Some were smoking pipes, and some were singing, and some were
dancing, and many were laughing, laughing as it seemed without
reason or end. And some were hammering planks together and
building.</p>

<p>There below the crossroad, where there had never been any
stone raised before by living hand, tents, Tinkers’ wagons,
and weird scaffolding loomed against the black sky. It would
have been Midsummer’s Eve during the day. Lady Agatha caught
raucous laughter, and the lewdest Tinker songs, and the clapping
of unseen hands.</p>

<p>Off to one side she saw two great stallions, and on the
horses sat a woman and a man. They were at the far edge of the
firelight, and the redness just caught at them, so that the
tails of the horses and the backs of the woman and man were
drifting into the black between the pale white stars.</p>

<p>The woman and man wore wide hats, masks, and heavy riding
cloaks draped from their shoulders. The man’s cloak was
scarlet, and on its shoulder was embroidered in black the letter
A. The woman’s cloak was black, and bore the same letter in
scarlet.</p>

<p>The dancers went round and round, and from time to time one
of the riders gestured, and a young strong lad, or a bold lass,
went shyly before them and spoke words with them for awhile.</p>

<p>The strange child went past her, and Lady Agatha called after
it, ‘Who are those two now, and what will they be wanting with
the lasses and the lads?’</p>

<p>The child laughed and said a thing, but all she could catch
of it was, ‘—to the abbey!’</p>

<p>The firelight limned the scaffolding with a hellish light,
and the rising planks were seeming almost alive, as if this was
a place where the timbers dwelled, and no human folk at all; and
Lady Agatha rode away from there, thinking if anything this was
a worse place than lost Dublin itself.</p>

<p class="break">SHE WANDERED INLAND away from the roaring
nightblue sea, to a marsh land, the border of the county of
bogs. The air was quiet there, and the whispers in the winds so
soft that at times she wasn’t even hearing them.</p>

<p>A few small hovels stood by the road, pitched on the bog’s
edge like a village. During the Day the squatters of the place
had earned their bread with the hard toil of digging in the
bogs, carving out peat-clods and drying the turf for fuel.</p>

<p>Now the cottages were darkened and still. For a moment Lady
Agatha thought she saw the dark form of a woman standing
pointing beside one cottage, right on the lip of the bog. Agatha
raised her arm to wave to the woman, but a sudden weakness took
her as of labor, and an ache as of childbirth, and she tumbled
out of the saddle to the ground.</p>

<p>The dark form moved – it was a woman, after all.</p>

<p>Softly the countrywoman bent over Lady Agatha lying in her
fine white dress, dirty and bemired. Then putting fingers to
mouth, the woman whistled thrice. Six ragged children appeared
quick as the wind, and together they bore Lady Agatha into the
farthest hovel.</p>

<p>Where the countrywoman laid a black shawl over Lady Agatha,
where she lay on a stone by the blue turf-fire. When Agatha
moaned and showed some life was still in her, the woman gave her
to drink. Porter it was, more warming than the fire.</p>

<p>‘One of the weakening-spells you had, let her bless you,’
the woman told Lady Agatha. ‘They come over some when they are
lacking. A lady so fair, it’s sure some men will be missing
you.’</p>

<p>‘It’s brightness and warmth I’m wanting,’ answered
Lady Agatha. ‘Not any man at all.’</p>

<p>‘You’re like poor Agnes then,’ said the woman.
‘Moy-rua, six mouths to feed, and a seventh on the way! My
darling took off in the fire. He went to the abbey, to gain a
great fee. It tore at him cruel to see me working so hard. But
surely my love’ll be coming back to me! Only, the thing of it
is, when he comes back, what of the grawls? He’s got no great
love for them.’</p>

<p>Outside, Agnes’ children played in the bogs. It was every
blessed one of them had stayed awake, freed from catechism and
labor and glad of it all as of a high holiday.</p>

<p>‘Here, now,’ said Agatha, ‘take this book and read it
to your children. It is a favorite of mine, and I’m sure
they’ll love to hear the tales.’</p>

<p>The woman took the book in her hands and squinted at its
smooth, worn spine.</p>

<p>‘You’d not leave your children, now?’ asked Agatha.
‘For him?’</p>

<p>‘Well, but the grawls can see to themselves, after all. And
I do yearn for him!’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha drew off her jewelry, and put rings and pins and
bracelets into the poor woman’s hands.</p>

<p>‘Take these and be selling them, and feeding your
children,’ she said. ‘Do not go away with him, he will prove
you false as before. I would give you this too, but it is dear
to me as my life, and I cannot bear to lose it.’</p>

<p>That piece, the only she withheld, was an emerald on a gold
chain. It was himself, the lord, gave it to her for the price of
her beauty on that night when she had gone, a captive bird
drunken with kindness, into his bed. So young, so very young she
had been!</p>

<p>‘And promise me now you would not go with him.’</p>

<p>‘O Miss, I cannot be saying any such thing, and if that is
the price of your bounty I cannot take it at all.’</p>

<p>‘Take it, take it!’ scolded Lady Agatha. ‘It is for
your kindness now. But tell me at least you will think of your
children.’</p>

<p>Agnes held the jewels in her lap, more wealth than she had
ever known. Lady Agatha could not see her eyes.</p>

<p class="break">THAT FELL OUT on Imbolc or Midwinter, when
Brigid’s fires are lit. And upon that same darkness, while
Lady Agatha was resting in the loft, she heard voices at the
door.</p>

<p>‘Come inside, and bide a while,’ called Agnes’ voice
softly. There was a lilt in the voice, and all the weariness
gone clean out of it, the way Agatha hardly knew it.</p>

<p>And a man’s voice answering, ‘Ah well, Nessie, and you
know it’s not for them I’ve come. Come back out instead,
close the door my dear, and give me kisses three.’ She heard
Agnes laughing like a girl, and the closing of the door, and
nothing more.</p>

<p>‘Children,’ she whispered. ‘Do you not hear the voice
of your father, now?’</p>

<p>‘We hear it,’ their whispers answered her. ‘But whoever
told you he was our father?’</p>

<p class="break">WHEN AGATHA rose out of dreaming, Agnes was not
in the cottage nor anywhere near, and her pot by the fire was
cold.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha walked out of the hovel. The moon was not yet up.
A few stars were glimmering through the clouds. Agnes’
children were looking at the other cottagers, slyly.</p>

<p>From the back of the house a dark causeway led snaking down
into the bogs. Deep into the wet black earth the people of the
hovels had been digging, cutting cliffs out of the hills,
delving into the past. In the mud at her feet Lady Agatha found
a silver spur. Carefully she wiped it shining and clean, looking
down the causeway.</p>

<p>Surely it was this way Agnes had fled with her lover,
forsaking children for the sake of lust. In the Day, Lady Agatha
would have sent sheriffs and the King’s men after her. But no
one would return her to her duty in this Night.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha left the silver spur for the children and rode
away, turning at hazard, until the bogs were well behind her.</p>

<p>Behind her Agnes’ children passed the silver spur between
their dozen dirty hands. The looked up past the cottages, and
saw a fire burning on a far-off hill, and they gathered twigs,
quietly, and trooped off towards the fire.</p>

<p class="break">AS TO LADY AGATHA, she was wandering for many a
moon, through Beltane and Lughnasadh, bitterness in anger
burning her, until she found herself at the edge of a wood. And
even there she was not free of him and the shame he had put on
her.</p>

<p>Below the wood, down the slopes, some dark stones of
buildings littered the riverbank like tombstones. And if it had
been still day, Lady Agatha would have said the place had the
look of the city of Cork. But what place was it in the
Night-Land?</p>

<p>Under the moonlight many birds were gathering. The birds were
small and black and swift, coming in troops of twenty and
thirty, some out of east, and some out of west. Those out of
east all flocked together at one end of the city, and those out
of west flocked at the other end. They were squealing and
squawking at each other, for hours on end. She watched them with
admiration, and not a bit of fear.</p>

<p>She sank down on the moss and closed her sore sad eyes. And
she was resting in the moonlight, and nursing her bitterness,
and dreaming what to do.</p>

<p>While the woman was dreaming, the winds fell slack, and the
sky cleared above, so that Moon and stars shone straight down on
the old face of Earth. Upon a strange sound and noise made as
well on the one side as on the other, the birds took wing into
the sky, and the two sides encountered each other with such a
terrible shock, as the Night sky darkened with their feathers.
And the starlings fell upon the houses, into the river, and over
all the Irish land, wounded and slaughtered, dead in the
streets, rent, torn, and mangled.</p>

<h2><a name="ch06"></a>6. Of Aengus on the Watchtower</h2>

<p class="first">MASTER AENGUS rode down to the sea, to the
point of Knockadoon Head. He had gone there always, ever since
his seventh birthday when a lady had taught him the Moon’s
first name. And that had been the start of his seeking after
knowledge, possessed him all his life. As if it had been rather
wholeness he was seeking, and to retrace his steps to a place
forgotten and lost.</p>

<p>The roar of the white sea came calling, as the wind off the
cliffs caressed him. The immeasurable mass of the Sea, like some
inverted continent, broke groaning on the rocks.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Aengus, smiling: ‘and I missed you,
too.’</p>

<p>There was a pile of stones on Knockadoon Head, and that old,
very old. Once heroes of the Five Kingdoms had lived here. It
had been their dun, their fortress. Perhaps the beautiful Hound
himself had stormed these walls; perhaps Finn had feasted here;
perhaps Diarmid and Grainne had found here an hour of shelter
stolen from their endless circle flight.</p>

<p>The top of the pile was broken, and there in the gap Master
Aengus stood, the salt winds kissing and curling his hair. From
thence he looked into the stars burning the waters of the
bay.</p>

<p>He thought on the woman who had been, once, his fever. No
more was he feeling that madness for her. No more was she that
magical creature, distant and strange, he’d seen across the
lake. She was only Agatha. She was too real now.</p>

<p>‘Tell me then, my darlings,’ murmured Master Aengus,
‘Where is that song that once she waked in me? Where did it
go?’</p>

<p>As a boy Master Aengus had gone upon one rare dry summer
night into the lord’s preserve. Soon his dog had left him, hot
after a rabbit. Aengus himself walked alone through cool moon
shadows, moss beneath his feet, ferns against his shins. He was
fancying himself the lord, and that all this was belonging to
him.</p>

<p>He found a secret hayfield on that night, fenced in by trees.
He stood half in shadow, enchanted by the stalks all yearning
toward the Moon. He stepped unchallenged into her whiteness, and
walked into their whispers.</p>

<p>Many a time afterward he was searching for that field, asking
the tenants far and wide, but he never did find it again. All he
was finding were common fields, not magical at all, like his.</p>

<p>Master Aengus did not go to church, neither the new-painted
churches of the English masters, nor to the outlawed gatherings
of the priests of his kind. He had his own Bible. He had written
it himself. It was a book of but one page, and on that page but
one line, and on that line but one word, <i>No</i>. But he never
said <i>No</i> to his hayfield.</p>

<p>Much later, a grown man buried in studies, he was feeling
love for the first time in his life, for the smartly-dressed
young beauty whose family was ruined in all but their name, and
who was the old lord’s mistress, though some called her his
ward, and others still his wife.</p>

<p>He saw Lady Agatha across the lake, and he heard a song
rising in him, and Aengus recalled the summer night long lost,
and the whisper of the haystalks. He almost heard the whisper
again, and almost knew its meaning. To catch a word here and a
sound, and the sense of it just beyond his grasp. But all he
found he understood was what wind cried in the sedge. And then a
chill green rain was falling, and the lake was desolate.</p>

<p>He had not dreamt the knowing of her body would mean the
killing of her song.</p>

<p>And now in the dark of the moon on the Tower over the sea on
Knockadoon Head Master Aengus held a cípín of birch in his
hand. He snapped the twig against the old stone. ‘So be it,’
said he. ‘I do not love her. I will not love her. I’ll never
love again.’</p>

<p>Anger lashing out of his eyes, he pointed up the frayed bit
of twig to the moon over the sea. ‘I’ll go back to my
studies and put a bad name upon love. No more songs for me! I
defy you now more than ever I did before.’</p>

<p>And Master Aengus threw away the cípín down into the Sea,
into its white and roaring mouth. He listened to the waves. He
had promised a thing to her: would he do it? Would he dare?</p>

<p>‘Yes, it’s truth,’ he muttered, nodding down; ‘and
for memory of her song, I’ll do her this bidding, and bring
her back the Day.’</p>

<p>If he could. If it could be done at all.</p>

<p>It had taken every bit of Master Aengus’ learning, and the
most part of his strength, to break the axle and pierce the boil
and drown the Sun in Night. And since that time it was as if
part of his knowledge was blotted from his mind, and a part of
his strength was lost. He did not know Agatha had been stealing
his wisdom, poring over his texts in the attic room.</p>

<p>Master Aengus made a circle of hand-small stones about him on
the top of the tower, and laid himself down in the middle of
it.</p>

<p>For a full Moon and a moon Master Aengus stayed on the tower
by the Sea. He rose when the Moon went down, and when she rose
he dreamed, so that her light became part of his dream. And in
his dream Master Aengus traced the path to that place where he
must go, and he did what he must do, to waken Day and summon
back the Sun.</p>

<p>When he started forth from dreaming, it was in a palsied
sweat he was. He shuddering, and dragging his bent tormented
body to the edge of the stones, and looking down into the mouth
of the abyss.</p>

<p>And still the Sea was roaring, whitely roaring. It gave him
back some peace into the heart of himself, to hear that endless
song go on. He listened for awhile, gave her his blessing and
went down.</p>

<p>Slowly, as if still dreaming, Master Aengus rode through the
warm summer of the Night, past hayfields and dark woods, until
he came into the county of bogs.</p>

<p>He rode the deep paths below the wet black cliffs of peat.
The moonlight shone off the treasures buried in the peat, relics
of the ancient nights: shirts and cartwheels, spoons, combs,
bits of leather and hair. Those things had been buried there
since before St. Patrick’s day. Deeper and deeper into the
past he rode.</p>

<p>Master Aengus rode out of the bog into fallow fields. The old
moon was thin and broken in the cloud-flecked sky; the land was
dim and strange. It would have been Lammas in the day. It was
then he saw her, on a hilltop far away.</p>

<p>Delicate and graceful she was, palely gleaming. Her side was
to him, her face to the moon. Her body it was a slender arching
shoot, undulant as a willow.</p>

<p>She was a small hind, and her coat was white.</p>

<p>For a long time Aengus was watching her. She was a brightness
almost light, and somehow shadow for all that, so he could not
see her clearly. It made her less real.</p>

<p>Then she bowed and pawed the ground, as if to curtsy to the
falling moon. And she trotted away and was gone.</p>

<p class="break">THE DARKNESS was well on, and Master Aengus
lying on the bare ground, and his cheek on the hard dirt road.
He groaned, and rubbed the dreams away. He had forgotten the
hind now. He remembered his promise to Lady Agatha, and the
perilous path he must tread.</p>

<p>He started on his way.</p>

<p>He went up the hill out of the county of bogs, into the green
hills, and he went on his way, and all at once he halted, and
stared down on the ground.</p>

<p>He found a trail of tiny hoofprints on the ground. They were
such as a small hind might have made. For a long while, Master
Aengus stared at that trail. Then he left the path he’d been
following, and went in the way of that trail. It was the hunter
in him, he might not help himself.</p>

<p class="break">IN THE MIDDLE of Ireland he came upon a wood,
and round the wood stretched a thicket of hedge. The trail led
up to a stone patch in the ground before the hedge, and no
hoofprints led away out from the stone. Master Aengus tracked
round that stone patch, and up and down and back and forth
before the hedge, but no other hoofprints were there to be seen,
only those leading up, and not a one leading on away. Here the
trail ended. Master Aengus sat on the stone.</p>

<p>He had lost the trail. His hunting skill had failed.</p>

<p>After a time he looked through the ragged hedge, and spied
something white moving on the other side.</p>

<p>Very quiet he was, as he lifted himself up with his hands on
the icy stone, and crept forward to the hedge, and peered
through its pinholes at the thing that was there.</p>

<p>It was the white hind.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had seen her from so close. Her pelt
was white as ice. She was horned, and a collar of gold clasped
her neck. She was standing and stooping, and nibbling on greens
sparsely scattered among the tree boles. Easily she moved a few
steps to her right.</p>

<p>Now, he whispered in himself to her, I have you, and you’ll
not be free of me again.</p>

<p>Master Aengus stepped along with her. The hind was taking no
notice him. But he was looking through the hedge, searching for
an opening big enough for himself to be slipping through.</p>

<p>High was the hedge, half again his height, and he’d never
be scaling it in time to catch her before she darted away into
the depths of the wood. The only passages through the branches
and boles of the hedge were no bigger than his hand.</p>

<p>The whiteness of her moving down behind the hedge, and Master
Aengus creeping with her, step for step and move for move.</p>

<p>Down the way he could see a path in the field, and a darkness
like an hole in the hedge.</p>

<p>‘Be still now, my pet,’ whispered Master Aengus. He took
a step toward the path.</p>

<p>But at that, the white hind lifted her head, turned about,
and pranced deeper into the wood out of sight.</p>

<p>Master Aengus raced to the path. He bursting through the
opening in the hedge and dashing into the wood, but seeing no
sign of the hind.</p>

<p>A light snow began to fall. It was early for snow to be
falling.</p>

<p>In the middle of that wood Master Aengus found a lake. The
branches of the trees were white, and the margin of the lake a
silver collar made of ice. But the snowflakes shuddered and
burned to water in the black face of the lake; and Aengus stood
there stonily.</p>

<p>On the farther shore something was standing by the ice collar
of the lake. It was a small four-legged beast, and its pelt was
all of white.</p>

<p>It was herself. She was the white hind.</p>

<p>Master Aengus stood very still, waiting for her to come
around the lake.</p>

<p>But the hind lifted her head and looked about. It was shy and
nervous she was; she knew he was about. She was turning, and
about to go away into the wood.</p>

<p>I cannot run fast enough to catch her, he thought.</p>

<p>Master Aengus pulled an arrow to his ear.</p>

<p>I’ll catch her only in the flank, he thought. A little
wound, just to bring her down. I’ll bind her, heal her, and
tame her for my pet.</p>

<p>To the arrow he whispered, ‘Go fetch me what I’m seeking,
and carry it back to me.’</p>

<p>And if he missed, and the arrow struck too deep? But she was
almost gone now, and all at once the bowstring slipped his
fingers, and the arrow leapt away across the lake.</p>

<p>It caught her in the flank; the White Hind staggered from the
wound, but the arrow flew back across the pond, and stuck in
Master Aengus’ thigh.</p>

<p>He cried out and fell heavy on the bosom of the Earth; the
hind gave a little leap and vanished away.</p>

<p class="break">LADY AGATHA started, and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>She was lying on her mare’s saddle cloth, her body gray in
shadow, the folds of her skirts agleam with rime in moonlight.
Her mare was gone.</p>

<p>She felt the duration of her dreams in her shoulders and in
the ache of her hips. It seemed the longest time.</p>

<p>Where have I been, she was wondering. What have I done?</p>

<p>She brushed the ice flakes from her skirts. Ice flakes, and
it Summer still, by the calendar of Day! Behind her she saw a
wood ringed by a high hedge, that just at her back opened in a
deep, dark hole.</p>

<p>Before her a path was leading down across a river into the
Night. The path was dark with the litter of black feathers. A
few fires were burning on faraway hilltops. Arising out of
dreams of the Day, of brightness and society, Agatha was shaken
by the sight of the Night-Land. It was as though some immense
Hand had stretched forth and blighted the land, despoiling it of
human folk, of cheer, of reason, of safety. Somewhere behind
those fields, Master Aengus worked.</p>

<p>Silently she withdrew into the hedge.</p>

<p>In the interrupted moonlight she wandered through the wood.
The unleaved branches wove like wicker in the sky, burned by
fires in the last day, blackened into peace. A sort of path was
opening before her. A little snow was starting to fall. Far
ahead at a crossing, a beautiful creature stood in her way.</p>

<p>It was a small white hind, horned, wearing a torc of gold
about her neck.</p>

<p>Sure now, this is a creature too beautiful to live, Agatha
thought. A mere hour will doom her.</p>

<p>The white hind tossed her head and regarded the woman
shivering down the way. The hind was bloodied at her flank.</p>

<p>‘Who has wounded you, now?’ asked Agatha. ‘It’s no
more than you deserve, prancing about so trusting and
innocent.’</p>

<p>The sight of the hind rankled her. She was angry at her. The
helpless, sad-eyed, weakling! She was glad she was wounded –
she wished she would die.</p>

<p>The hind trotted off, limping and slow. Agatha followed the
blood spots in the snow through the silent, burnt forest. Soon
the snow halted and stars cut through the clouds.</p>

<p>She noticed she was limping. A tiny stone on the inside her
shoe was cutting her instep, a bitter wound.</p>

<p>The spots ended at a small ice pond, still and black as
sleep. The vanishing tip of the moon glinted off the ice, and
sank into the black.</p>

<p>Agatha could see a woman in the ice.</p>

<p>Rumpled and soiled was that woman’s dress, and her face
ghastly pale, the mouth pursed and hard like the pit of a fruit,
the eyes huge and dark. The look on that face she had seen too
many a time for her to be forgetting it now. It was a look had
frightened her below her window on evenings long ago, in the
face of Master Aengus.</p>

<p>But who should the woman in the ice be now but herself?</p>

<p>Lady Agatha shook her head, and laughed, and that was the
ugliest sound.</p>

<p>And once more the stars wheeled round to touch the Samhain
mark, when all souls and dreams are loosed. And for four and
twenty hours the Moon did not rise nor shine.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Year of Night</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the fourth year of that Night, the Waking
began to make a new society, without any looking back at the
societies they had moved in during the Day.</i></p>

<p><i>It no longer mattered what a man or a woman had been
during the Day. The Low were now High and the High were Low, and
yet some that had been low were Low still, and some that had
been high were High as before. There was no way to foretell
these things.</i></p>

<p><i>But there were some who seemed to have hidden bonds with
the Strong Places, and to know them as the Strong Places began
now to know them.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch07"></a>7. Of the Maid in the Wood</h2>

<p class="first">BEYOND THE POND the blood spots failed, or she
lost them; the path continued up. There everything was white,
even the trees in snow coats. The stars were eating up the sky
as Lady Agatha climbed among them. Beyond the hill the bow of
the moon slipped hugely into earth.</p>

<p>In another clearing, silent in starlight, nine trees stood in
a half ring before a snowy hall. Lady Agatha stepped into the
untouched snow, feeling it over the top of her shoes, secret and
chilling.</p>

<p>The nine trees were swaying as she passed them. The dim
starlight discovered strange features in the bark, like faces
smiling and closed.</p>

<p>At the door of the cottage she halted. Seeping through the
cracks of the door was the savor of onions, potatoes, carrots,
turnips and gravy. She all but felt her knees give way, the
smelling of it was so wonderfully keen.</p>

<p>Her fist, frozen and hard, rapped upon the door. A soft voice
answered from within. It was a young woman appearing at the
door, slender as a grass stalk.</p>

<p>Her hair was black as black could be, unpinned and fine,
clouding her face. Her face was small and delicate. The palest
blush colored her cheek, but her skin was else as clear as whey.
She wore a simple homespun kirtle, and you would have called it
white had you not seen it against her skin. Her fingers were a
wonder, slender and long, whiter than the ninth wave of the
sea.</p>

<p>She was the prettiest country-girl Agatha had ever seen.</p>

<p>‘Let her love all here,’ Agatha blessed the girl.</p>

<p>‘Mary increase you,’ answered the lass for a failte in
her turn.</p>

<p>‘I can offer you nothing for your pain,’ said Agatha.
‘But will you take me in, and let me warm myself?’</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ said the country-girl, pushing back the door.
‘Poor lady, you are burning up. Come in, sit by the
hearth.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha allowed herself be led across the clean swept
earth to a hob-seat on the stones of the hearth. The girl drew
off a bit of stew from the cauldron over the fire, pressing a
bowl of it into Agatha’s cupped stiff hands, and talking all
the while, the way of one too long alone.</p>

<p>All at once she stopped with a blush of a smile and said,
‘I am Maid Mielusine.’</p>

<p>‘I am Lady Agatha.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the company I’ll be glad of. I hope you will stay
a good long while! I wish we can be like sisters, do you think
that may be?’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha was leaning back against the stone, watching the
stew in the bowl on her hands, unwilling to eat it right away,
unwilling to show her eagerness. She looked up at the girl, at
her trusting eyes. ‘Yes,’ she said. Her voice was hoarse,
with a bit of wildness lurking in it; a perilous voice; the
voice of a lost soul.</p>

<p>‘Oh, but you must be thinking me only too forward!
There’s that difference in our stations, after all. But if you
could stay awhile, after you are well…’</p>

<p>‘Sure, this illness I’ll never be well of,’ said
Agatha.</p>

<p>The girl fell silent, abashed at her own eagerness. Lady
Agatha carefully supped the stew, cleaning the bowl and setting
it down by the hearth.</p>

<p>‘It is calm here in this place,’ she was murmuring.
‘There is peace here, and you are innocent, Maid Mielusine, as
I was. The perfume of your innocence pervades your house. I am
tired now, and weary so that I wish I could sleep as the
Sleepers are sleeping. But it’s the fever dancing round in me,
and I cannot rest for dreaming…’</p>

<p>‘You speak so wonderfully,’ whispered the girl. ‘Anyone
could tell you’re a great lady.’</p>

<p>‘I had such dreams, once. I was pretty enough, and free.’
She was staring into the fire, into white lines and black knots,
and the red tips of the flames where they vanished into
smoke.</p>

<p>‘And he loved me,’ she was murmuring, ‘and abandoned
all to be chasing on my heels. And in my innocence I was
scorning him, and mocking his pain with laughter. Folly!’</p>

<p>‘Moy-rua, it’s a bad fever has caught you, Miss. Let her
spare you! Don’t fret, there is no one else about.’</p>

<p class="break">THAT DARKNESS Lady Agatha lay in the girl’s
bed, the way Maid Mielusine could not rest. Three times the girl
climbed to the bedside, looking on her visitor to see that she
was real, and really there.</p>

<p>In her dreams the lady had turned her face away to where the
dark roof timbers swept down close and cozy above the bed. The
lady lay there, wan and flushed by turns, and her hair
bedraggled, and her gown in tatters. But there was no mistaking
her quality, as Maid Mielusine was assured. She was a lady.</p>

<p>Maid Mielusine sighed for clean delight.</p>

<p class="break">WITH THE RISING of the Moon Lady Agatha woke
and clambered down out of the warm bed in her shift. There in
the middle of the cottage she found herself alone. She stood by
the fire awhile, warming her hands and thinking. In the
firelight she looked on her palm marked with its black spot.</p>

<p>Maid Mielusine came back with a pail of water. Her cheeks
were less pale now, and some of the threads of her hair had
strayed across her brow.</p>

<p>‘And how are you now, Miss?’ she asked. ‘But you
shouldn’t have risen! Will you be wanting anything?’</p>

<p>Agatha shook her head no.</p>

<p>Then they ate a bowl of cream together, and spoke of this and
that.</p>

<p>During the day, Maid Mielusine told her, she had been living
in a cottage with her ma and her da and her sisters, Grisalta
and Merrwyn, and Mielusine the baby. But when her ma died, her
da changed.</p>

<p>‘Och, he was right enough with my sisters, but with me he
was hard hearted, I cannot tell you why. Of the three of us
girls, I looked the most like our ma, but still my da was giving
me the hardest chores, to be cleaning the pens and cleaning the
hearth until I smelled of dirt and ash.</p>

<p>‘&nbsp;“Sini, you’re no good,” he’d be saying.“Sini,
you’ve a pinched face. Sini, your nose is thin!”</p>

<p>‘Until one night my sisters wakened me, whispering, “Sini
dear, our da’s gallous cruel with you, and it’s worse
he’ll be to you before he’s better. Let you get dressed now,
and we’ll go from him for ever and a day.”</p>

<p>‘Shoes in hands, we tiptoed out. The night was like summer
in Italy, as they say in our county. The stars were shining in
the dew on the grass, and we girls walking barefoot in
heaven.</p>

<p>‘We had taken some cakes, and ate nuts and mugoreens from
the sweet briars along the way. Soon in the wood it was so warm
we did off our clothes, and naked in their shifts went bathing
in a pool, giggling and free. We little knew the Night was
hanging over us all.</p>

<p>‘The next day the sky was black until the red burst out of
the spot on the Sun, and fire was raining out of the clouds
everywhere, and I like a baby crying and running, the way I lost
my sisters in the wood and found them never again.’</p>

<p>The Maid fell silent, stirring a wooden spoon in her pot over
the turf. The lady observed her out the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>‘So you are all alone here?’ asked Agatha.</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said the maid, ‘I’m not so all alone as that,
Mary save me. There are my guardians; or should I be calling
them my children now! Would you see them, Miss? They’re so
eager to be meeting you!’</p>

<p>The country-girl drew her guest outside. They went into the
middle of the snow, to the nine trees planted in a crescent. Now
Lady Agatha saw that those trees were not bending of the wind,
the way there was none, but of their own will.</p>

<p>In the gnarled wood Agatha saw faces very plainly smiling
down at her: knotty cheeks, knotty eyes, and wide-pecked mouths.
They had no necks, and their arms were branches, some doubly and
some triply jointed. Their roots served for squat legs and
curling feet.</p>

<p>One by one the trees were bowing, stepping forward, and
introducing themselves to her.</p>

<p>‘They are my friends,’ said Mielusine, giggling at Lady
Agatha’s astonishment. ‘They cleared the glade, dug me
stones for warmth, and built the Honey House.’</p>

<p>‘What now!’ growled one. ‘She is our first guest!’</p>

<p>‘Aye now, Tadgh! You’re right about that!’</p>

<p>‘Celebration now! Dancing and mead!’</p>

<p>‘Mead and dancing, you mean!’</p>

<p>Laughing in gnarled voices, the trees were tipping over and
crawling into the hall, mindful of their branches brushing
through the door.</p>

<p>The maid served them from her cauldron, and poured mead for
the trees. Merry they were all, though keeping their distance
from the fire. They were singing and drinking and winking, and
even went so far as to make the maid dance a jig with them,
clumsy as they were.</p>

<p>Mielusine fell back at last breathless beside Lady Agatha,
and brushing her locks from her brow. ‘Ah!’ she was saying,
‘That’s work, now!’</p>

<p>‘But this is a marvel,’ said Agatha. ‘What are these
trees, that they speak and walk and dance?’</p>

<p>‘Well, but I told you, sure, how as I lost my sisters? And
then I’d nowhere else to go, it being all night and strange,
and so I went back to my da’s. But the cottage door was closed
with sleeping. Then I wandered in the wood, until an owl and a
swallow told me the magic of honey. It was honey I spread over
the mouths of the trees, and charmed them into life.’</p>

<p>‘And here we are!’ said Finn, loudly, the way mead was
ever raising his voice. ‘Mary bless us, as good as saplings,
some of us!’</p>

<p>‘Ho, but Finn, you’ve a few holes now, begging your
pardon – better watch those woodpeckers!’</p>

<p>‘Watch yourself, Ned my lad, for your bark is
curling!’</p>

<p>‘Sini, come hither, bide a while upon my knee?’</p>

<p>One great tree swept up the maid from her seat and swung her
round in a great galloping reel. The others stamped the earth
with their rooty feet, marking time of the measure and shouting
their complaints and cheer.</p>

<p>‘Shawnee, boy, don’t be so boisterous, can’t you see
you’re all but bumping Sini to the ground?’</p>

<p>‘Moy-rua, I am a hobby-horse, and let her make me a fast
one!’ said Sean; and sure enough in a matter of moments the
maid, giggling and blushing, slipped to the ground. Ned swept
her up in his branchy arms and spun her round the hall, his
rooty feet clumping and kicking the floor.</p>

<p>By moonfall the trees were mopping their brows and blowing
out their brown cheeks, and stumbling out to their circle again.
Where they stood leaning in the snow, snoring and snorking.</p>

<p class="break">THE SMOKE curled blue and cheery from the hole
in the roof of the hut under the Moon. Inside Lady Agatha and
Maid Mielusine sat on the hob by the hearth and told each other
of their lives. Lady Agatha told of dances and masquerades, of
journeying to Dublin and across the sea to London, where the
King’s house was. Maid Mielusine blushed to have nothing to be
telling but her own narrow life.</p>

<p>‘Why do you not go looking for your sisters?’</p>

<p>‘But I’m afraid of what I might be finding, there outside
the wood.’</p>

<p>‘So pretty you are, and living like a hermit.’</p>

<p>‘Well, but I have my trees now, and we are happy.’</p>

<p>‘Are you now? I dare say cows will be happy enough grinding
their teeth in the middle of a field. But a girl of your charms
might aspire to more. Look at you now, your hair all tousled and
draggling. Let me comb it out for you.’</p>

<p>With an amber comb she combed the girl’s tresses; and the
while she was combing, Lady Agatha set to singing a bit of old
poetry, with softness and ease as of long practice:</p>

<p class="left">… <i>come forth,<br>
And taste the air of palaces; eat, drink<br>
The toils of empirics, and their boasted practice;<br>
Tincture of pearl, and coral, gold, and amber;<br>
Be seen at feasts and triumphs; have it asked<br>
What miracle she is? set all the eyes<br>
Of court a-fire, like a burning glass,<br>
And work them into cinders, when the jewels<br>
Of twenty states adorn thee, and the light<br>
Strikes out the stars! That, when thy name is mentioned,<br>
Queens may look pale; and we but showing our love,<br>
Nero’s Poppaea may be lost in story!</i></p>

<p>Lady Agatha’s voice murmured away, and Maid Mielusine felt
the words sinking inside her, seducing secret dreams.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure we must seem low to you, Lady Agatha. You are
used to such fineness of manners. I’m sorry for my trees.
Their hearts are kind, and maybe I’m no better, and too humble
and coarse to be your friend.’</p>

<p>‘You are not low, merely untutored. That you could feel
such regret shows you capable of better.’</p>

<p>‘Will you tell me more of courts and ladies?’</p>

<p>Agatha eyed the Maid thoughtfully.</p>

<p>‘What is it you’re wanting to know?’</p>

<p>‘Oh – fashions, dancing, and courtly manners! I’ve
dreamt of it always, you see, to be a lady, elegant and sought
after!’</p>

<p>‘But that’s the least part of a lady, Mielusine. These
elegant ladies are the stupidest showhorses you ever did see.
What truly makes a lady is much more than that.’</p>

<p>‘What, then?’ the maid was asking after a bit.</p>

<p>‘Ah, as for that, you do not want to know it, Mielusine! I
did not know it, and am sorry now I learned.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me, please, Agatha! For how else will I ever be
anything but the merest, commonest country-girl?’</p>

<p>‘There is danger in my lessons, Mielusine. Stay rather as
you are, the way you are pretty as the third moon, and that
ought to be enough for anyone.’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ sighed the Maid, letting her head tilt down to
her breast, and looking away.</p>

<p>But it was late for warnings. In the Day Mielusine had been
content to be a cottager’s daughter forever, the way that
would never be changing any more than the Sun. But now the Sun
was gone, and in the darkness trees could catch life, and why
could herself, Maid Mielusine, not become a lady?</p>

<p>‘It is love makes a lady,’ said Agatha, after a long bit
of silence. ‘Love and suffering ennobling her.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t my trees love me?’</p>

<p>‘Your trees? They know no more of love than you, my goose.
There are two paths of love, Mielusine. Bright and broad is a
boithrin, and that green lane glimmering in the Sun beside
golden flowers all the way down to the blue Sea. But I can’t
be helping you there, you see, it’s not that path I
know.’</p>

<p>‘What is the other path like, Agatha?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that one, now! Narrow, twisty, treacherous. You cannot
see the end of it at all. And its banks are hemmed in with
primroses dark and voluptuous as Eve’s own lips. But their
brambles clutch and scratch at you, and a dark man waits hidden
in the thorns. He’ll watch you suffering, and smile and offer
you his hand, but he’ll press you back with the whole of his
body into the swallowing fragrance of the briars.’</p>

<p>Mielusine stared at the lady, her eyes big as her fists.
Agatha caught that look, and laughed a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>‘That is all I know of love. It’s the great heart is not
poisoned by it. Only one or two ladies of a hundred might have
managed it. These are the ones, bear the secret marks of their
passions on their bodies and their souls. But the rest of us, we
have been maimed by it, soured and gone old before our
years.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha’s voice was falling away into the merest
whisper, and it was only the hissing of the fire filling out the
silence.</p>

<p>‘It is wonderful, what you said,’ whispered Mielusine.
‘Ah, do you dream I could ever be like the one or two?’</p>

<p>‘It must come out of the untouched depths of you, out of
your untried heart.’</p>

<p>‘Please.’</p>

<p>‘I might teach you, Mielusine,’ said Agatha after a bit.
‘But I’d want you to repay me.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll do anything,’ said the girl.</p>

<p>‘Do not be promising so quickly as that! It’s a burden
and a danger you’d be taking onto yourself. Who are you but a
girl, helpless and innocent as a hind, to be daring anything so
terrible? You make me laugh! But here now, don’t be pouting,
girl! Forgive me. A dark man’s put a spell on me, and I cannot
be breaking it. And I’d be wanting you to save me.’</p>

<p>Sadly, Mielusine shook her head. ‘It’s not a blessed
thing I know about spells; let her save me from all such!’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t beauty sorcery?’</p>

<p>The maid looked at Lady Agatha for a long while. Then she
said solemnly, ‘I don’t understand. But I will do anything
you tell me. Only, teach me love.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha went on combing the fine black tresses, but she
was not answering the maid, only looking at the fire, and her
thoughts far away.</p>

<p>‘I will make you beautiful, Mielusine,’ she was
murmuring. ‘Beautiful, beautiful…’</p>

<p>‘Am I really pretty?’ Mielusine asked. ‘I’ve never
seen a mirror.’</p>

<p>‘I will make you a mirror in the face of every man. And
most of all in his.’</p>

<p class="break">THAT DARKNESS it was the Maid lay down in her
bed, the way Lady Agatha would have it no other way.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha went before the hearth. Where like a dog she cast
herself down on the warm stones. And she gazed upon her open
hand, upon its hollow with its little black spot.</p>

<p>Oh Aengus, Aengus, why did you need embitter all the
sweetness on the world, and change the day to Night?</p>

<p>She buried her face in her arms. But like a poison still she
felt his fever working in her blood, like rust, like sickness,
like a pregnancy. It was his song, come back to torment her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch08"></a>8. How Agatha Taught the Maid of
Beauty</h2>

<p class="first">AENGUS broke the arrow from his thigh. But a
sliver of the head, and perhaps a bit of the hind’s own blood,
stayed in the wound and lamed him. And the pain was not half so
hurtful as the sight haunting him, of the dark spot of red on
the white white coat, put there by him.</p>

<p>‘Come back to me, let me heal you,’ he cried. But the
White Hind was gone.</p>

<p>Only her curse echoed in his ears, in silver tones across the
ice:</p>

<p><i>You, who hunted me, will find no cure for your wound, not
from herb, nor root, nor sage, nor poison, until the woman
wakes, who for love of you will bear a greater pain than any
woman ever bore.</i></p>

<p>He knelt in the snow by the burning black lake, and cursed
himself aloud.</p>

<p>And after a time he rose and he turned, and he trudged out of
the wood. Round and round the ring of hedge he walked, until in
the snow he was finding some tracks; he took those tracks to be
hers, and followed after them.</p>

<p>Behind him in the wood, a dark man stepped out from behind
the bole of a tree, and walked down to the lake.</p>

<p>He was tall, that man, and wore a dark gray greatcoat cóta
mór against the cold, and a tricorn hat, and a muffler round
about his neck and chin. The dark man stooped and picked up the
fallen bow and arrows, and he followed the footprints out of the
wood. He was trailing after Master Aengus, and keeping his
distance.</p>

<p>From that hour onward, Master Aengus wanted nothing in the
world so much as the White Hind: and she the one creature of all
creatures denied him.</p>

<p>Winds went in the way of him, and he was wandering, Master
Aengus, through wood, through hills, and through fields, even to
the shores of the English Sea. Imbolc passed by with a thousand
thousand need-fires burning, and the Cailleach took in her
firewood, so much that it was a sure sign the cold would be
staying, and and Beltane and Lughnasadh. He had put Lady Agatha
out of his mind. It was the White Hind in his dreams, and the
fever going round in him, the way he was starting to hear a new
song, the song of the White Hind.</p>

<p>It was her curse on him singing in his heart: <i>You, who
hunted me, will find no cure for your wound, not from herb, nor
root, nor sage, nor poison, until the woman wakes, who for love
of you will bear a greater pain than any woman ever bore.</i></p>

<p>One darkness I will find you, he muttered, and I will do what
I will do. We are meant for each other, you and I, hind and man,
game and hunter.</p>

<p>And a thought came to him.</p>

<p>In the brightness of day, it would be easier to find her.</p>

<p class="break">AS THE MOONS PASSED over the Honey Hall, Agatha
taught Mielusine manners and speech and dancing, and the art of
beauty. It was hard Mielusine was finding the lessons. Never had
she dreamt there would be so much to it, and a right way and a
wrong, of doing every blessed thing. But Agatha’s whisper came
back to her. <i>I will make you beautiful, Mielusine. Beautiful,
beautiful…</i></p>

<p>So Mielusine submitted, and worked at her lessons with a
heart and a half.</p>

<p>And Lady Agatha was teaching her a mystery, and that the
hardest of lessons: the art of promise, and of seeming to know
what could never be known.</p>

<p>‘I do not know the mystery,’ Mielusine was saying. ‘I
have never suffered, I have never loved.’</p>

<p>‘And what does that matter, now? Become the veil concealing
you. What will Aengus know, seeing only the veil as he will?
When once he has torn it, then you will have loved; and when you
see what lurks at the back of his eyes, then you will have
suffered. Draw away from him then, and he will follow you for
ever and a day after: it’s free I’ll be then. But else it
will be yourself who is lost in my place!’</p>

<p>Now, Lady Agatha had kept the cloths Master Aengus’ art had
made for her. And she made for Mielusine a gown out of the
white, paler than starlight and brighter than the moon. It
suited Mielusine just so, and she was enchanting in it.</p>

<p>‘Agatha, how can you make such a thing?’ she asked.
‘There’s surely magic in your needles and shears!’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha’s pale lips smiled, and she put away her
pins.</p>

<p>‘Agatha, what is it? Mary spare you!’</p>

<p>Agatha looked on the maid without seeing her. Then she shook
her head and took up her pins again.</p>

<p>‘No, it is nothing, nothing at all.’</p>

<p>‘Have you some hurt about you? Can I not heal it?’</p>

<p>‘It is not – well, it is love.’</p>

<p>‘But how can love be bringing you such pain?’</p>

<p>‘You don’t know love,’ muttered Lady Agatha.</p>

<p>Once on a time the maid could hold her tongue no longer, and
she said, ‘Tell me of your love, Agatha. Do tell.’</p>

<p>They were alone in the hall, but Lady Agatha glanced about
even so. ‘I knew love once,’ she answered. ‘I thought I
knew. But he was untrue as a dream.’</p>

<p>‘But did you never love another? Did you never love?’</p>

<p>Agatha thought of the lord, the old rich man bent from the
loneliness of his years.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she said. ‘I never loved. It was not love, or it
was not I. Listen, Mielusine. It was this very Aengus, caught me
in love. He murdered my protector and, come the Night, held me
prisoner in his house.’</p>

<p>‘I hate him for what he did to you,’ said Mielusine. ‘I
hate him!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, as for that, I’m much in love with hating him. But
Mielusine! Even here in your house far away, and I not even
knowing where in all the world he is, it’s my body calling out
to him, and in dreams he’s coming mocking me. I’ll never be
free, unless you save me.’</p>

<p>‘But how can I be doing that, Agatha?’</p>

<p>‘It’s unbreakable his spell over me will be, unless
someone else should win his heart and break it. Be my arrow,
Mielusine! That would end his power.’</p>

<p>‘I will try, Agatha. Let her help me! Tell me now, what
must I know, what must I do, to be winning Master Aengus’
heart.’</p>

<p>And Lady Agatha set to telling her.</p>

<p>Maid Mielusine had her trees build a bed for Lady Agatha.
They did that grudgingly; they made but half a job of it; but
Agatha delighted in its rough planks and its straw closing about
her body with barely room to turn. She had had no such lovely
bed since she was a girl. It was cold that winter, but Lady
Agatha made the little bed warm with her own warmth.</p>

<p>It was there, in the house of innocent Mielusine, that Agatha
first began dreaming of Master Aengus. It was of his hands upon
her body she was dreaming, in the first Moon of the Night, and
of her mouth on his.</p>

<p class="break">SPRING IN THE NIGHT-LAND was not far away off.
The snows melted back to black. The women went out of the hut
more often. The maid was ever asking after Master Aengus.</p>

<p>‘Tell me the way of him, Agatha. Tell me his weakness, and
how I may be hurting him best.’</p>

<p>‘Here is his portrait, Mielusine. He is dark, and sometimes
sullen; knows many a secret thing, and cares nothing for the
shows of beauty or wealth. So he says.</p>

<p>‘And his voice is like a shiver of beaten iron. And there
is anger in him, letting him know at rare times joy, but
happiness never at all. His step is brisk even when he’s bound
for nowhere. And what he sees when he looks on a field or hill
or stone or woman, that is not what any other man would be
seeing. If he think you shallow he will despise you, but if he
find you pure (and that’s but another saying of the same
thing), then he will love you, for an hour or a day, to
distraction. Until a word or a look of yours will tear the veil
of his delusion.’</p>

<p>They turned back by the way of the ring of nine trees then,
and all the nine bending and bowing and smiling down on the
maid, jealous of each little favor she bestowed on this one or
that. Agatha was quiet for a time, lost in her own musings.</p>

<p>At the door of the hut Agatha came up to a stop, sudden-like,
and gripped the maid’s shoulder, tight as an owl’s grip.</p>

<p>‘Never soften toward him, Mielusine! Whatever she may be
feeling in her heart, no lady will show affection for such a man
as Master Aengus. She knows that that would be the ruin of
her.’</p>

<p>The maid was breathing hard, and biting her lip. Agatha
loosed her hold, and the two went in. Mielusine pulled the door
to behind them. ‘Is he so cruel then?’</p>

<p>‘He is worse than cruel, Mielusine. He is sincere. And he
is capable of passion, that is more than longing and stronger
than love. ’Tis the rare soul has the heart for it.’</p>

<p>‘Is passion finer than love, Agatha?’</p>

<p>She laughed, a woeful laugh, to see in her heart how easily
she drew the maid in upon the toils of her web. ‘Perhaps for a
few. But the passion of a Master Aengus is like a blow, like
hatred, like murder. Such a man needs a lady equal to his
challenge, taking his love and making it her own. It is war
between them, Mielusine, and was I not telling you from the
start, you’d not be liking my lessons?’</p>

<p>The maid was looking into the fire. And she was thinking,
deep in her heart: He only loved her, after all. But aloud she
said,</p>

<p>‘I think you might still love him, Agatha, no matter what
you say.’</p>

<p>A dismal, delighted laughter was breaking from the lady’s
lips; she answered, ‘Perhaps ’tis so, apprentice! But do not
be taking my weakness for a strength!’</p>

<p>And Mielusine was thinking: All Lady Agatha said, of the
great lady loving and suffering and loving still, is it not the
very truth of her?</p>

<p>They went into their separate beds, those two, and bade each
other fair sleeping. The Maid lay awake and still, pondering
questions deep and dire. Agatha fell sleeping, deep and bitter
sleep that would bring her no refreshment when she had woke;
sleep full of dreams.</p>

<p>And last of all in that dark of the moon, she dreamed of the
mark she had put on him.</p>

<p>The echoes of his song were yet lingering in her head, and
the manor house still bright with fire, when Master Aengus held
her red naked in the great carved bed, and kissed the hollow of
her back. It was the last rising of the moon before the house
fell still and cold; and he holding her as though knowing what
was to come.</p>

<p>He was sucking in her flesh between his teeth, and the warmth
she was feeling there turned hot as a poker. She broke from him,
startled, and kneeled on the floor on the far side of the
bed.</p>

<p><i>It was my mark I was putting on you</i>, he said. <i>I was
marking you there where none will ever see, save you in your
glass, and I.</i></p>

<p>She felt in the hollow of her back, the small upraised skin
small as a fingertip, pointed as a star.</p>

<p><i>Now</i>, he said, <i>Let you mark me where all the world
will see.</i></p>

<p>She cast back her hair and let her eyes wander angrily about
his naked body. An odd stinging was burning the tips of her
breasts.</p>

<p>He put out his arm, showing the wrist. <i>Here</i>.</p>

<p>She leaned over and pressed a quick kiss there. But she was
shaking her head no.</p>

<p><i>Mark me</i>, he said.</p>

<p>She put her lips on the skin so thin that even in the gloom
she could see the dark veins joining and parting like streams in
the bogs.</p>

<p><i>Draw in the skin with your lips and your tongue.</i></p>

<p>She was tasting the salt and the oils of him, the dark
inexplicable life of him passing between her teeth. She was
aroused, angry and afraid all at once, and she bit the warm
blood into her mouth, until the rankness of it choked her and
she had to turn away spitting and coughing on the floor.</p>

<p>He’d worn a bandage on his wrist for half a Moon
thereafter. The mark showing there was sometimes ghastly and
pale, like a blister’s dead flesh. Agatha hated it. Himself he
seemed proud of the mark, as if it had been his mark over her,
like a bill of sale, and for that she was hating and softening
toward him all at once.</p>

<p>And now, lying in the rough, narrow bed, feeling the spot
upon her like a birthmark, she was dreaming of her marking of
him: the thin skin trapped between her teeth, the acrid sudden
warmth. If she had bitten any deeper, he had perhaps died of it.
His blood had tasted bitter, bitter at first. It was as if she
might never be spitting out the last of it. As if the least drop
of it had entered into her veins, infecting her with his madness
and enchantments.</p>

<p class="break">THAT SPRING Lady Agatha made a gown out of the
red cloth for the maid. It was scarlet as Magdalena’s smile,
and the way it was cut it left the girl seeming more naked than
nakedness itself. She herself went scarlet, did Mielusine,
looking down at herself caught in that gown.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ she whispered. ‘Does it have to be
indecent?’</p>

<p>‘I will make it fit you,’ Lady Agatha said. ‘Do not be
hesitating or it will be spoilt.’</p>

<p>The girl stepped down the hall, glancing at the wonder of the
gown herself was wearing. The trees were staring as if their
eyes would pop like corks: Mielusine was seeing herself in those
knotty eyes, a wonder strange and daring.</p>

<p>Mielusine stepped out. The frosty air rushing in set the
trees shivering. Mielusine smiled, and walked back in.</p>

<p>Returning, she wasn’t quite the same.</p>

<p class="break">NOW, WHILE MAID MIELUSINE’S charms were
blooming, Lady Agatha’s were withering. She would not let the
least of Mielusine’s hairs be straying in any way
unflattering; her own she left uncombed. She made gowns for
Mielusine in the height of fashion; she left rents in her own
frayed skirts, or patched them but indifferently.</p>

<p>And still the Night was lingering. Had he forgotten his vow
to her? Had he perished on the way?</p>

<p>‘Nay now,’ she whispered, sitting hugging her knees in
her bed. ‘It’s alive he must be, and I know it. I am not
done with him yet.’</p>

<p>But his spell was now so strong over her, she was dreaming of
him every darkness, her body taut for what he had wakened in
her, those things unknown in the three full years she had been
the old lord’s ward.</p>

<p>In the red fire glow, in the house of innocent Mielusine,
Agatha would be warm and wanting him in her bed. But when she
was rising, for very shame she planned out her retribution all
the more severely.</p>

<p><i>Do you think you’ve prevailed, now?</i> she was asking.
<i>Do you think you can despise me? Let you wait, O Aengus!
You’ll see my Mielusine, and it’s weak you’ll be then, a
common man again, and I’ll be laughing, free of the likes of
you…</i></p>

<p>One night he had come below the manor windows singing songs
of sorrow. Oh, they were horrid songs for he was no singer, and
the misery in his voice murdering every note.</p>

<p>Embarrassed for the sake of Lady Felicia, Agatha was opening
her window and casting down the first coin her hand came upon,
and that a golden guinea. ‘Pray take that for your pains,’
she called to him, and shut the casement. The very next day she
saw him in the village, and he wearing a chain round his neck,
and on the chain her golden guinea.</p>

<p>He was a part of her life wasn’t ended yet. But it would be
herself would be deciding when they next would meet, and how
that should be.</p>

<p><i>I paid you for your song, my Master. And now you must be
paying me for mine.</i></p>

<p class="break">IMBOLC lay behind them, and Beltane followed
after, and yet the Night-Land stayed cold, and the snows fell
back across the hills. Winter lingered.</p>

<p>In the dark of the moon, Agatha went to the pond. It was
frozen over still. She was wearing a broad cloak she had made of
castoff woolen patches: warm it was, and she underneath it
mother-naked without even a shift.</p>

<p>There was a cutting wind, and the sky beclouded, and darkness
out of the sky above and the earth below, and all the Sleepers
sleeping and the Wakeful dreaming, and Agatha crouching over the
pond. For twelve Moons and a moon she had been fashioning the
Maid. For twelve Moons and a moon she had been readying herself
to do for the Maid what went beyond all nature.</p>

<p>She scratched away some snow, making the black earth show
through. And she took those things she had been gathering, and
set herself to work.</p>

<p class="break">THAT DARKNESS Mielusine might not rest. But
seeing Lady Agatha gone out, and herself all alone, she crept
out of bed.</p>

<p>Hastily she threw off her bedshift and stepped into the red
gown.</p>

<p>She stood in the center of the hall, upon a stone, stretching
to her tallest. And the gown glowed in the emberlight, gleaming
along the ridges of its folds, restively rousing as it rose to
swallow the dim pale body of the maid.</p>

<p>Extravagantly Mielusine cast bundles of wood into the hearth.
The fire awoke the scarlet of the gown; the crimson in the
flames danced between the rafters, and Mielusine’s own
nakedness within the gown cast back the same color.</p>

<p><i>If only one were here to see!</i> she thought.</p>

<p>‘I am ugly now,’ Lady Agatha had told her, ‘but I know
the virtue of beauty, that is the worship of the earth. It bears
its moral burden, beauty. You must be beautiful to be good.
Mielusine, it’s this you were made for. It’s a duty you’ve
been shirking living here alone like a frog under the ice,
charming trees to life by your innocence. It wasn’t chance led
me to your door. On this Night you are of the Wakeful,
Mielusine. Wake then!’</p>

<p>Now Mielusine knew the vanity of being pretty in a house in
the empty wood. She was wanting the aching of love, the rapture
in it, the wasting from it. She’d been heeding Lady Agatha’s
lessons.</p>

<p><i>Where is one to find me now?</i> she wondered. <i>Who will
see and claim me?</i></p>

<p>The fire was low again, the red gown put away, and Mielusine
snug in bed when Lady Agatha, dark-faced and frozen, brought
into the hall what she had made.</p>

<p>She touched the girl under her chin.</p>

<p>‘Behold the final seal of your beauty,’ she said.</p>

<p>Mielusine looked on it as a girl would have looked on the
burning shrine of Saint Brigit. ‘It is the loveliest thing I
ever did see,’ she said softly as a prayer. ‘But it is too
fine and fairy-like for me.’</p>

<p>‘It is the likeness of the White Hind. And it is
yours.’</p>

<p>It was a demimask with horns above, a braided tail behind,
and for the throat a golden torc. Lady Agatha placed the
girl’s hand upon the mask, making her feel its gentleness.</p>

<p>‘Three masks I made for you, Mielusine,’ Lady Agatha was
saying. ‘The mask of manners, the mask of fashion, and this
one last of all. When you will be wearing this, you will be as
undeniable as Venus in Her zone.</p>

<p>‘No man but will be drawn to you alone. No hour will see
him free of the longing for you. The sight of you will be wine
in his brain, hashish in his blood. Gladly will he offer his
life for but a smile and word of praise from you, his judge and
his redeemer.’</p>

<p>But that talk frightened Mielusine. ‘Oh, Agatha, it’s in
your debt I am, for all you taught me. But that is a power too
heavy for me. Let her spare me, I cannot wear it!’</p>

<p>Even then the young moon was rising, and the trees were
knocking at the door and vying angrily with one another, who
would be first to greet the maid. Hastily Mielusine hid the mask
in her chest before the trees might glimpse it.</p>

<p>The trees behaved themselves that moon, and did not bicker or
fight, or trip one another with their rooty toes. They saw the
maid’s distress and were wondering, each in himself, what bad
thing he had done to trouble her.</p>

<p>The maid was quiet and pale, and no happiness in her. Softly
Lady Agatha went among the trees, feeding them mead until they
staggered out to their ring, leaning at odd angles, drunk in
dreaming.</p>

<p>In the hob seat by the hearth Lady Agatha dried the girl’s
tears and combed her hair. Mielusine sat with her shoulders half
turned, and her head held away, in just the right way to be
showing herself. Her eyes were troubled and far away, and her
breast rising and falling.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha murmured, ‘Now you are beautiful.’</p>

<p>Slowly the maid bent back her head on her swanlike throat,
and looked upon her friend. She looked at her with the look
Agatha had been teaching her, the look of sadness, and of
seeming to know the unknowable. And Agatha thought to herself,
<i>Mask or no mask, did Aengus see her now, it’s damned in
love he’d be with her.</i></p>

<p>‘It’s still love I don’t know,’ said Mielusine, in a
gentle, dreaming voice. ‘Who will teach me that lesson,
Agatha?’</p>

<p>‘When the time is right, I will find you a man.’</p>

<p class="break">THAT DARKNESS Mielusine lay in bed, and beneath
the sheets her hand lay reaching for the touch of the mask of
the White Hind. And the dreams were coming to her there, and she
dreaming on a great house golden alive with candlelight, music,
and dancing. Herself was walking in the road outside, not daring
to go in though she wore her fine white gown. But something was
drawing her up the road toward the house, slowly up to the dark,
open gate.</p>

<p>Master Aengus met her there. He was only a figure in the
gate, black against the gold yard, but Mielusine knew him.</p>

<p>In the darkness gleaming white as nudity, she curtsied and
greeted him as Agatha had taught her.</p>

<p><i>You are not my lady</i>, he said angrily: <i>Where is
she?</i></p>

<p>His eyes were daggers, and Mielusine in her dream was
stumbling, down the falling road, away, away…</p>

<p>She sat shivering in her bed, bowing her head. Through the
veil of her hair, she glanced at Agatha in the rough bed.
Something of youth and peace was softening Agatha’s face,
streaked with dirt though it was.</p>

<p><i>All the same, I am more beautiful than she. I am! And yet
my beauty is only what she made of it. Were I there in rags,
dirty and coarse, would I be beautiful then? She is.</i></p>

<p><i>My prettiness is empty and vain. Her beauty is pure and
passionate. It’s suffering ennobles her. She is walking the
treacherous path. Her quality is proven. Master Aengus saw to
that.</i></p>

<p><i>I want to be like you, Agatha. I want you to be proud of
me.</i></p>

<p>She crept down out of bed, and quietly opened her chest. It
was there for her, its gentleness so deceiving, its emptiness so
magical. She lifted up the mask, and looked on it for a long,
long while.</p>

<p><i>But even you are lacking this, Agatha. And I will follow
you down that path. I will dare that adventure. It’s only
because I love you so, Agatha, I must have a teacher no less
than yours. I will have Master Aengus be teaching me of
love.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch09"></a> 9. Of the Bitterness of Beauty</h2>

<p class="first">IN THE NIGHT-LAND laws were forgotten, prisons
emptied, and tax-men shut up snoring. Titles were tossed aside,
armies disbanded, churches left locked and forsaken. The world
of Day had been ruled by men pious and old; the Night was for
the young, the charming, and the wicked. Courts were opening
everywhere, round needfires lined with tents and rude wagons for
now, but soon building palaces with tilting gables.</p>

<p>Outside the quiet wood, outside the ring of hedge, the land
of Ireland was sparkling with thousands of such fires, burning
into eyes brilliant with hopes, ambitions, wild desire. It was
no world for the faint of heart. Only one law was dredged up out
of the past. Pleasure ruled all their wild hearts; and the seat
of their parliament was in the abbey in the mist.</p>

<p>Alone in all the landscape of the Night, alone of all the
Wakeful, Master Aengus looked to summon back the Sun.</p>

<p>There had been a rock in his dream of bringing back the Sun;
he climbed where the blind birds wheeled. There had been water
in his dream; he crossed the sea into the dark continent of
Europe. There had been voices in his dream; he stole through the
ruins of cities, oppressed by the sleepfulness of the peoples of
the Day. Through all that year Master Aengus searched.</p>

<p>And the Sodality of Light found Master Aengus, in a ruinous
abbey on the Rhine, and offered him a way to the bright shore,
where the Black Sun was shining, if he would forsake the White
Hind. He answered them, ‘Before your light I will take my
darkness, because it is mine.’</p>

<p>Master Aengus went into the kingdom of France, and from
France he went to the kingdom of Spain, and from Spain he went
by way of the black, blind sea to Scotland, where all the
children ruled, and from Scotland to Wales, where he found no
way to summon back the Sun. At last, defeated, he sailed back to
the Irish land, on the dark of the moon when Lady Agatha used
his art to conjure up the Mask.</p>

<p class="break">NOW THE FORMER HAPPINESS of the Honey Hall was
gone. Maid Mielusine teasingly would be trying her arts upon the
trees, and a jealousy sprang up amongst them they had never
known before. Each boasted of the smallest duais of a kiss the
maid granted him, until another won a more recent award, driving
the first into the dark wood, groaning and hacking dead trees
with his ax.</p>

<p>Agatha left the Maid and her trees, and she went out of the
hall without her cloak. She walked up the top of the hill, where
the trees were sparser, and the sky loomed over the dark. The
Moon was just rising out of the south: the second moon after she
had made the Mask, and the fields still spangled with the red
embers of a hundred needfires. The brightness of the Moon and
stars was glimmering off the snow, but clouds soon came,
blotting out the sky again, and light, stinging snow began to
fall. And for a space of three hours she was standing on the
hill cloakless in the snow, shivering, looking out.</p>

<p>What had happened? Where was he?</p>

<p>She turned back down the hill.</p>

<p>Maid Mielusine was stirring the mash in her cauldron in the
glade for the animals in her byre. Pigs and cows she had, that
had come grunting and lowing to her in the darkness, lost, and
she’d taken them in for pets.</p>

<p>Agatha stayed by the edge of the wood, watching the maid and
wondering, <i>Is she ready yet? Is she strong enough?</i></p>

<p>Already Agatha knew she had waited too long. The dream of the
moonlight was troubling her. And yet she herself was putting off
those words to Mielusine: ‘Come get your gowns, we will be
going now, to hunt down Master Aengus.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha saw one of the trees lurching across the glade,
and bending over the maid. The Maid, alarmed, dropped her paddle
and hurried away with the tree into the wood.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha watched them go. <i>Not yet</i>, she was
thinking. <i>She is too tender-hearted still, and
harmless.</i></p>

<p>Straightway Mielusine had seen the terror on the wooden face.
‘What is it, Conn?’ she asked. ‘What has happened?’</p>

<p>‘Something – something awful, Miss. Let her spare me,
it’s Owen. I killed him. Yes, I’m sure he’s dead.’</p>

<p>‘Take me to him,’ cried Mielusine. Along the way she
coaxed the tree to be telling her what had happened.</p>

<p>‘It was my idea, Miss,’ Conn said. ‘We were digging,
and Owen pulled out a big stone split in two, warm and
beautiful. I said to him then, “This is just the right stone
to hollow out, the way the birds will be coming and drinking
from it. You know how Mielusine loves her birds.” It was my
idea, Miss, and I only wanting to please you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Conn. But Owen?’</p>

<p>‘Well, Owen said that was just what he’d been thinking
all along. He wanted all the praise for it, you see, to cut me
out completely.</p>

<p>‘So I got mad and said, “Why, you termite nose! It was me
came by the idea. You would’ve used the stone like all the
others you get, to warm your rooty toes when you snore. Get
another rock for that, but I’m taking this one, and it’s
me’ll make the bird pool for Maid Mielusine!”&nbsp;’</p>

<p>‘Does it matter that much who made it, now?’</p>

<p>‘No, Miss, I suppose not. Yes! You are so lovely now. We
know we don’t deserve you. It was my idea. Why should that
knot-nosed Owen win a kiss for it?</p>

<p>‘But he wanted it, you see, and wouldn’t let go. So
“Owen,” says I, “I’ll take that stone now if you please,
and if you won’t, then I’ll take it with your hands
attached.” And I pull out my ax to show him I mean it. I was
sure he’d back off then, Miss. Only he didn’t.</p>

<p>‘Next thing is, we’re on the ground kicking, and
there’s Owen reaching for his shovel to give me a whack. That
maddened me, and I went for him. I guess the ax was still in my
hands, and when I came to my senses there I was standing and
swinging, and Owen on the ground, and splinters flying out of
him.’</p>

<p>Tears welled in the maid’s eyes. ‘Is that what happened
now?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Miss, and I’m ashamed for it. Straightway I flung
down that curst ax of mine and came begging your pardon before
my nerve failed. I’m hateful, and you’ll never smile on me
again.’</p>

<p>His step slowed. ‘That’s it, Miss,’ he said. ‘Just
over that knoll. I can’t go nearer, Miss, don’t ask
me!’</p>

<p>‘All right, Conn,’ said Mielusine.</p>

<p>There was earth mounded up on all sides in the glade, strewn
about with rocks from the pits in a tri-na-chiele. In the middle
lay a broad round stone, and Owen.</p>

<p>Mielusine knelt over him. Her gentle hands ran up and down
the knotty flesh. She was feeling the deep gouges in him, where
the wood shone raw and fresh. On every hand the faces of the
others were peeking from behind the piles.</p>

<p>‘Come, my lads, and help me,’ she called to them. ‘I do
not think that he is quite beyond all hope, but I must have him
back inside the hall.’</p>

<p>Charily they came down amongst the dirt-heaps, even Conn.
They shouldered Owen’s body, and trudged the long way home.</p>

<p>Inside the door they laid him down. Great sugary tears were
oozing from their eyes. Softly Lady Agatha stepped inside the
door, watching.</p>

<p>Mielusine hung Owen’s belt on his peg on the wall. She took
water from her cauldron and washed Owen all over, head to toe,
root to crown, covering him with the bubbling warm foam. By his
branching hair she held him, drying him with towels.</p>

<p>Then she made a paste with herbs and her honey, thick in the
bottom of a dark old crock. And she filled in his wounds with
the paste, squeezing the gashes together. With the last of her
honey, she daubed his wooden lips.</p>

<p>Then, at last, she was kissing him. She was kissing his eyes
and his honey-smeared lips.</p>

<p>But when Mielusine washed Owen he did not sputter. And when
she daubed the honey on his lips, his mouth did not open. And
when she kissed his lips there was only the taste of honey in
her mouth, and under that a bitterness, of raw wood.</p>

<p>Tears were streaming from the Maid’s eyes onto the great,
long, chopped-at log. She turned to the others; but at the look
that was on her then they all shrank back. Last of all
Mielusine’s eyes sought out her friend, Lady Agatha, standing
by the door. For a still, soft moment the two women were
regarding each other.</p>

<p>Agatha turned, and stepped out of the hall.</p>

<p>On the border of the Night, Agatha looked up to the Moon.
Still was the air, silent and deathly the wood on the dark hill
side.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the Maid had been pretty as the
reflection of a star in a pool’s calm water. The difference is
always this, the way prettiness is innocent, beauty is knowing,
prettiness comes of nature and beauty of art. And all art is
dangerous.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha had made her beautiful in the way Master Aengus
thought of beauty. She knew and none better, what beauty he was
seeking. She had made a country-girl into the embodiment of
Master Aengus’ dream, the better to be snaring him and freeing
herself. But at the same time she robbed Mielusine of her
innocence.</p>

<p>Had Mielusine still been innocent, then the charm of her
honey would have brought back Owen’s life.</p>

<p><i>It is almost ready she is</i>, Lady Agatha thought. <i>She
begins to know, what a thing her beauty is. Now let her take
pleasure in it.</i></p>

<p>Lady Agatha lifted her head, taken by a sound in the air. It
was not the wailing from the hall, of the virgin Maid and her
trees. It came from down the hill, from the deep of the wood.</p>

<p>It was the beat of horses Lady Agatha was hearing, and the
baying of hounds, and the shouts of men.</p>

<h1><a name="part2"></a> Part II. <br>
The Waxing of the Moon</h1>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a> 10. Of What Lay Buried Beneath the
Sea</h2>

<p class="first">DOES HE come to us now? she wondered.</p>

<p>Fifty horsemen rode into the moonlight, reining in their
mounts. Their dogs swarmed around Lady Agatha, white as sows
with blood-red ears, showing their teeth.</p>

<p>Gray were those men, steeped in old sins. They might have
been King’s men in the Day.</p>

<p>The foremost tilted back his hat and laid his hand gently
upon the stock of his gun. ‘Mary bless all here,’ said he in
a foreign voice, shouting down the hounds.</p>

<p>‘Let her increase you,’ answered Agatha. ‘What can we
be offering you gentlemen?’</p>

<p>‘Hunting a rogue, my girl,’ he said. ‘A thief, and a
murderer no doubt. Have you seen aught of him? For he’s surely
come into this wood.’</p>

<p>‘We’ve seen no one, the way you fine sirs are the first
guests we’ve had since Day. But one of our men saw tracks in
the snow down the way yonder.’ As well to be rid of them, she
was thinking.</p>

<p>Grimly the men traded glances. ‘My thanks, girl. Tell your
men to be keeping their eyes open, and you keep to your door. If
we cannot find him before moonfall, perhaps we’ll be accepting
your hospitality.’</p>

<p>Then ‘Away, my lads!’ he rumbled, and the pack of them
turned. Only Lady Agatha called after them asking, ‘But just
what is it this man’s done to you?’</p>

<p>At which the hindmost looked back at her. It was a murderous
half-smile on his lips, and he answering her, but his foreign
tones were beyond her ken under the crashing-away of horses and
hounds.</p>

<p>The door to the hall was open a crack, and the cottager’s
daughter looking out with reddened eyes.</p>

<p>‘What was it?’ she was asking.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha smiled and answered, ‘The last running of the
law.’</p>

<p>Now the door opened wide and the trees appeared, bearing the
chopped log between them. In the glade they dug and planted it,
the fallen tree that had been Owen. Mielusine was weeping and
moaning over him, and the knotty trees chanting, some last rites
they were inventing.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha went into the hall.</p>

<p>Just at moonfall the sounds of the chase redoubled –
screams, brays, and gunshots exploding in the quiet wood.</p>

<p>After a time the echoes lapsed away.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha sat at her sewing. Maid Mielusine sat by the door
looking out at Owen, unable to eat.</p>

<p>The trees were in their circle again. Their branches were
bristling now at those strange sounds, and what they might be
meaning for the maid.</p>

<p>In the middle darkness shouts rang off the door and Lady
Agatha went out.</p>

<p>‘You may tell your masters now it’s done,’ the gray man
told her. ‘The traitor’s dead. We’ll not be troubling you
more, the way it’s a hard track to be following, and a long
way to be going home for us.’ He seemed tired and hollowed
out, now his work was done, and he empty-handed from it all.</p>

<p>They all fifty rode away then.</p>

<p>‘It’s never they’ll be finding their home again, I’m
thinking,’ Agatha said. ‘They played the Night and
lost.’</p>

<p>‘What of the man they were chasing?’ Mielusine said.
‘At very least we can see him rightly buried.’</p>

<p>‘With what rites? Is it a priest you’ll be looking for
now?’</p>

<p>‘Faith, it might be Master Aengus!’</p>

<p>Agatha looked at the girl. She had not seen such strength in
the pale face before. It raised a touch of doubt in herself.
‘It isn’t him,’ she said. ‘It could not be. But if you
must, we will go looking.’</p>

<p>In thin darkness they were wending their way down the hill,
the maid and the lady, and the trees slowly catching up. Oimell
Moon it was, the beginning of Spring by the old calendar of the
day, and the hill still caked in snow.</p>

<p>It was fear was in the trees. They had been happy once on a
time, alone with Mielusine. Lady Agatha had ended that. Now
those horsemen were come, with guns and growling dogs. What
other evil fortune would follow?</p>

<p>In a deep lost place they found a horse, its reins caught in
a tangle of thorns growing from the snow. The skin of snow in
the place was torn, and the black earth seeping through like
blood. Not far off they found the man, face down in snow.</p>

<p>Agatha stared at him, fearful now. He was of a height and a
color and a shape, could have been Aengus after all.</p>

<p>‘Is he dead now?’ whispered Maid Mielusine.</p>

<p>Lady Agatha soothed the horse and bent over the rider. She
caught him by the shoulder, turning his head.</p>

<p>It was a stranger.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she said, breathing. ‘This one’s not
Aengus.’</p>

<p>‘But how goes it with him?’ asked the maid, stepping
closer.</p>

<p>‘He’s shot, and the hounds have worried at him,’ Agatha
said. ‘And those are not his only wounds.’</p>

<p>The man let out a groan. ‘But not dead now,’ he said
‘—not yet.’</p>

<p>He tried a thin wan smile, but his face paled and his eyes
rolled up and round. All the blood ran out of his head and he
slumped back on the snow, moaning.</p>

<p>‘He is burning with fever,’ said Agatha. ‘And pale from
bloodloss … but his voice is from a land across the sea,’
she added wonderingly.</p>

<p>The Maid turned to the trees, only now arriving. ‘We must
bring him to the hall.’</p>

<p>Grumbling, the trees set about lashing wythes and cípíns
together. When they lifted the stranger up on the bier, the wet
white snow under his body was black and red with blood.</p>

<p class="break">HE WAS SHAKING and shivering with wet, was
Master Aengus, when he stepped back upon the wet Irish sand on
the dark of the moon. He put back his cloak, and raised his face
in the snow and icicle rain, and looked up into the secret
huddled masses of hills.</p>

<p>Now he was driven back almost to the place he’d started
from. And now the dream was lost, and he knew not at all how to
be bringing back the Sun.</p>

<p>‘What now?’ he muttered. ‘What now, and where?’</p>

<p>He shouldered his pack, and set off down a path. In thirteen
darknesses Master Aengus journeyed round the coast, to the great
cliffs of Moher over the Western Sea.</p>

<p>That was Imbolc Moon now, Candlemas, and the land was starred
with a thousand needfires cold and white in the Night. During
the Day, the land would have been greening, and Spring not far
afield. But still the deep cold it was gathering, and at the
back of the north the Sea was groaning and cracking with ice.</p>

<p>Atop the cliffs, at the very edge, Master Aengus stood, wind
curling his hair, his head swimming with suaran.</p>

<p>He made a rope and clambered down the cliffs, and found a
little strand hidden tucked away neat as a puffin’s nest. He
limped along the strand, over rocks and cobbles chased with ice.
The waves curled round him silver in the Moon’s pale light,
like the combed manes of petted ponies; and the end of the Sea
seemed far away.</p>

<p>And from the waves Master Aengus heard the sea-morgans
calling out to him and singing, and their song drew tears from
his dark face, the way the morgans sang to him.</p>

<p>He found a curagh caught upon the strand, and over it one
wrapt in a seaman’s woolen coat, a tricorn low on his brow.
His head was big as a pumpkin, and the collar and his muffler
concealed his face.</p>

<p>‘Is it your curagh?’ asked Master Aengus. ‘What will
you take to let me sail it out upon the waves?’</p>

<p>That one turned his icy eyes on him, and all at once Aengus
knew him.</p>

<p>The muffled figure answered him never a word. He raised his
arm, and one long finger pointed to the sea.</p>

<p>Aengus kept his eye upon the muffled one, while he put his
bundle in and took the curagh into the sea’s bright foam. At
that the thing upon the shore turned and started pacing slowly
back and forth, its black shoes breaking the ice upon the sand,
crack-crunch, crack-crunch. Thirteen steps north and thirteen
south, slowly, like a clock.</p>

<p>The wind blew the waves between the floes to dancing wild
reels, but Master Aengus on the moonpath stood up in the curagh,
pulling the sheet taut in his fingers, and the little boat shot
forth as if out of a cannon, skipping across the waves.</p>

<p>The Imbolc Moon sank, and darkness swallowed up the little
boat. Round about blind fishes came, souls of lost drowned
girls, speaking girlishly:</p>

<p>‘What is this boat my hand is feeling? What man is here, so
far from land?’</p>

<p>‘I am Master Aengus,’ he answered, defiantly: ‘Tell me
the secret of the Sun. How may I do what I will do?’</p>

<p>‘We know, we know!’ said a second. ‘Let us help him
now!’</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ said the third: ‘we are blind, now. What good
would it do us, even if Aengus could do what he will?’</p>

<p>‘Go back then if you will, but we will help him on.’</p>

<p>And the blind girls caught the curagh with their cold
slippery arms, two at the stern and one at the bow, lashing
their long fantails with all their might, bounding forward
faster than the wind.</p>

<p>Master Aengus heard their voices piping in the hiss-wash of
the waves, and he thought of Agatha’s voice, the way she had
been in the Sun.</p>

<p>Deep in the Western Sea the sightless fish-girls took the
boat, to the island that was there.</p>

<p>‘Is this the end of my journey?’ asked Master Aengus.</p>

<p>‘Go ashore, and eat your fill!’ the fishes answered
slyly. ‘Mind you don’t get burned!’ There west of all
lands they left him, and swam back to the shallows.</p>

<p class="break">AT MOONRISE Master Aengus stepped out on the
shore.</p>

<p>On the island he found water and fruit, and it was warm
there. He went up among the tall waving grasses, looking
eastward for the way back: but the tidal waters came climbing
after him, washing up to the trees.</p>

<p>Master Aengus climbed higher, but the waves climbed after
him. Until he reached the top of the island and it all sank down
beneath him, under the water, and Master Aengus with it.</p>

<p>The waters were boiling around Master Aengus’ head, bubbles
bright as candles about his eyes. He sank straight down, holding
his breath.</p>

<p>In the sea-light he could see plowed fields green with sea
weeds, and the blue spires of lost churches, and folk working on
the land.</p>

<p>Master Aengus felt warmth beneath his feet. The top of the
hill was a ridge, and it rippled like a scallop’s shell. And
through the cracks a light was streaming in thick golden
ropes.</p>

<p>It was the Sun, buried in the seabed.</p>

<p>Master Aengus knelt and put his fingers to the ridge. With
all his strength he strove to open the crack. But the heat
burned his hands even in water; and the last of his strength
went out of him like a drop of water on hot coals. Bubbles
bursting from his lips, and he sinking on the ridge, and moving
no more.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>11. Of the Irish Witch</h2>

<p class="first">MIELUSINE was nursing the nameless man. At
first she would give him her own bed, but Lady Agatha would not
hear of it. They covered him with blankets and left him on one
of the benches. At the point of moonrise the Maid found him
sprawling naked on the ground. He was groaning strange words and
scratching the scabs of old wounds, and his nails red with his
own blood. Mielusine was horrified.</p>

<p>She washed him all over with water from her cauldron, and the
trees bound him in blankets with their belts. They put him in
Agatha’s bed, and Agatha slept on the floor by the Maid’s
bed.</p>

<p>The Moon was rising and sinking again, and the man still
groaning in sleep through it all.</p>

<p>At the last, when the snow was melting up the hill, reason of
a sort came back into the man’s dark eyes. Mielusine loosened
the bonds on him and let him dream freely, smoothing his hair
and cooling his dampened brow.</p>

<p>‘He is healing now,’ said Lady Agatha. ‘You saved him,
Mielusine.’</p>

<p>Mielusine sighed. She was thinking of Aengus.</p>

<p>‘He is well-born, Mielusine: comes of finer folk than you
have ever known. Still, he might find you pretty.’</p>

<p>Mielusine bowed her head. ‘My heart is trembling.’</p>

<p>‘For love, so soon?’ asked Agatha.</p>

<p>‘For fear,’ answered the Maid.</p>

<p>‘The life you knew is over now. Prove your art on him, make
him fall in love with you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the maid. ‘I’ll do that.’</p>

<p>She was looking athwart the dreaming man, to the black shape
of Owen planted in the yard. What was she thinking of? Her mouth
was smiling.</p>

<p class="break">THE NEXT DARKNESS Lady Agatha and the stranger
went away. Mielusine and her trees were eating when the two of
them returned, and Agatha presented him.</p>

<p>Pale he was still from his fever, but his hair was cut and
combed, his beard shaved, and he wearing clothing Agatha had
made for him. Indeed he was well-made after all, and straight
off the trees were hating him. He said his name was Eudemarec,
and his country the principality of Brittany.</p>

<p>‘My lady,’ he said to Mielusine, ‘your woman here told
me it is thanks to your kindness I regained my health. I’m at
your service for your pains.’</p>

<p>‘I could not let you die,’ she answered.</p>

<p>‘Many could not have helped it,’ he said. Then the blush
was deepening on Mielusine’s cheek, and she caught at her
white gown with one hand, absently, casting down her gaze.</p>

<p><i>She is perfect</i>, Agatha was thinking. <i>Could I have
taught her that?</i></p>

<p>Sullenly the trees made room on the bench for the man, and he
shared their meal, complimenting the Maid on the excellence of
it.</p>

<p>‘Well, what I’m wanting to know,’ grumbled Neil, ‘is
who were those others, and what wrong you did to them.’</p>

<p>‘Neil!’ protested the maid; but the stranger only
smiled.</p>

<p>‘Old comrades in arms of mine they were,’ he answered
softly.</p>

<p>‘Will you not tell us your story?’ asked Mielusine.</p>

<p>Eudemarec sighed. ‘It’s only this,’ he said, ‘that
I’m so long on this road after my enemy, I hardly know the
start of it now. And there’s pain in it for me, and the man I
might have been.’</p>

<p>A silence was flowing down from the rafters. The trees were
swaying in their places, supping mead. Mielusine was all but
speaking, but Agatha made a sign to still her.</p>

<p>And in that silence, they heard the Breton’s voice as if it
came out of the rafters, as he began his tale.</p>

<p>‘I come,’ said the voice, ‘from a rich and noble
house…’</p>

<p>It was a house among the oldest in Brittany, descended from
the Roman legate Postumius. In the third year of his legateship
Postumius found a maiden on a hill. On her arms she bore the
marks of Druids, and in her hands she held a golden cup.</p>

<p>‘I stole it from the Druids,’ she called down to him.
‘Who drinks from it will have health proof against all
sickness, and live a fortunate life.’</p>

<p>Postumius took the cup, and he took the maiden for his wife,
the way her hair was golden as the cup. He betrayed his city and
fled with her where the mists come rolling over the woods from
deep in the uncrossable Sea.</p>

<p>That was the founding of Eudemarec’s house. And the heart
of his house was the gold cup.</p>

<p>Father would pass it to the boldest of his sons. The baptisms
of the family were always made with it. In war and darkest time,
through plague and burning, that cup was handed down, until it
came into Eudemarec’s father’s hands. Eudemarec was his
father’s seventh child, and the favorite. It was his the cup
would be.</p>

<p>One day Eudemarec was called into his father’s study. To
the young man’s eye it seemed a great age had been added to
his father: overnight he was shrunken and infirm.</p>

<p>‘My son,’ he said, ‘it’s foolish I’ve been, and a
curse is fallen on us all through my folly. Mablaith, my
black-eyed, black-haired, black-hearted Irish witch, is gone.
And the cup of our fathers is gone away with her.’</p>

<p>‘I will win it back,’ said Eudemarec. ‘In seven days’
time I will strike Mablaith down for treachery, and you’ll
drink from the cup with your own lips. I swear it!’</p>

<p>But a month had passed, and he had found neither cup nor
maiden, when he learned that his father was dead.</p>

<p>‘Now you are lord over our lands,’ Eudemarec’s brother,
the jansenist abbé, told him. ‘Give up this seeking for
vengeance on the woman, who is damned. The cup is idolatry, let
it be gone with the godless past.’</p>

<p>Eudemarec did not listen. That night he turned his back on
his brother and his lands, and he walked with the gray mists
deep into Broceliande, the forest without end. His hatred for
Mablaith was his only thought. He knew she was near, but he
could not find her.</p>

<p>It chanced he heard an owl in the mist. He followed its voice
and found a yew tree, and under the tree a little hut, and in
that hut Mablaith was hid. He found her sitting by the fire.</p>

<p>‘And with that,’ said Eudemarec, ‘I laid a pistol up
along her head.’</p>

<p>Mielusine shuddered, but Agatha said, ‘Go on.’</p>

<p>‘Mablaith, seeing her life was balanced on the point of a
pin, pleaded with me. “My noble young Sir,” she told me,
“let you not be cruel to me! I did not steal the cup – your
father gave it to me! It was always you I was longing for. So
often I saw you,” she said, “wanting your touch when it was
only his old hands on me. If at last I took the cup, it was only
that I knew he’d be sending you after it.”</p>

<p>‘Her bright face was stained with tears, and all at once I
knew she had not been running from me all that time, but only
waiting for me to come to her…’</p>

<p>For a long while in the dim hall, before the trees and
Mielusine, Eudemarec did not speak, lost in that moment – his
mind reeling, Mablaith sobbing, the wind in the forest, the
pistol heavy in his hand.</p>

<p>He had always, he said, longed for Mablaith. It was that
desire so fired his hatred. And then he looked down and saw the
pistol in his hand. What a blasphemy her death had been, the
bright face broken and the brains black with powder on the wall!
He threw down the pistol.</p>

<p>‘In that moment,’ he said softly, ‘I was lost, and
hers.’</p>

<p>He betrayed his father and all his fathers. He never returned
home; he kept to his ionarbadh. He renounced his own name, and
took to calling himself Eudemarec, that had been the name of an
ancient enemy of his house.</p>

<p>Eudemarec and Mablaith lived at the forest’s edge; he sold
the cup and they lived well enough. When their monies were
dwindling, he took Mablaith with him into town, to the gaming
houses. ‘Hold my hand,’ he told her: ‘I cannot lose, and
you are there.’ He played at faro, and he won. Soon he had won
enough to make his own bank.</p>

<p>Each night Mablaith was going with him, until the jealousy in
him, at the looks other men were giving her, made him send her
home. And then he did not always win. The end of it was not hard
to see, for when he won sums he spent them on gifts for her, and
when he lost he went into debt.</p>

<p>Then the last Day came.</p>

<p>Night fell, this endless Night, and passion for the cards
kept Eudemarec awake. But Mablaith alongside him was sleeping,
and she did not awaken.</p>

<p>It was then Eudemarec took to the road, wild for its danger.
He fell in with bandits. They were robbing with impunity: there
were no soldiers in the Night.</p>

<p>To the empty village at the forest’s edge the band was
returning, where Mablaith lay sleeping in the chamber only
Eudemarec could enter, for grace of having been sitting there
beside her when the Night fell. Eudemarec stored the robbers’
treasure in Mablaith’s chamber, where it was secure.</p>

<p>And they trained rampant thorns to grow about the village
against all intruders, leaving only one gateway clear.</p>

<p>In their empty hours the bandits were gambling and wagering
their hoard. Eudemarec laughed at the poorness of their dreams;
he laughed when he wagered and lost. Without Mablaith wealth was
empty. The others marveled at him; that was why they trusted
him.</p>

<p>Only one piece Eudemarec never wagered. The cup of his
fathers had been won in a raid. He did not drink from it; he
laid it upon Mablaith’s breast, wreathing her chill fingers
about its stem.</p>

<p>When the ramparts of brambles were complete, Eudemarec went
no more a-raiding. He was worrying lest he return and find the
gateway grown over. The others they were grumbling, and eying
the door to the chamber that was closed to them. But still and
all they went.</p>

<p>Eudemarec feared none of their wild words. He lingered in the
empty village, in the treasure room. Treasures stacked to one
side, Mablaith sleeping to the other. His eyes were on her.</p>

<p>It was a long while Eudemarec was silent. Then he heaved up a
great sigh, and carried on:</p>

<p>‘Softly I stepped to the bedside. I bent over her, my
shadow slipping over her, and I kissed her cold, cold mouth. I
laid my hands upon her shoulders, bent down, and kissed her
cold, cold mouth again.</p>

<p>‘I had lighted a hundred candles outside the chamber, for
within it no flame could live. The candles making an oppressive
heat, the sweetness of their burning making the air
unbreathable.</p>

<p>‘Golden and russet gleamed the treasure, saffron and silver
the countenance of my love, my bride. Her pallor seemed to me
the height of beauty. Her loveliness was greater for having been
consumed.</p>

<p>‘It seemed I slept – I must have slept, the way I did not
dream.’</p>

<p>Once more Eudemarec fell silent, so that Lady Agatha and the
maid thought him lost in the brambles of his story. He fetched a
sigh, and spoke again.</p>

<p>‘That darkness – that darkness I left the village. I left
all that treasure. I closed off the gateway through the
brambles. No one can enter there now, until the dawn come and
kill all those nocturnal thorns. But will the dawn ever rise
again?</p>

<p>‘Behind me I could hear my bandits riding round the
ramparts, discharging their guns, hacking with cutlasses at the
iron thorns, vainly trying to burn away the barrier. I turned my
back on them.</p>

<p>‘I was thinking of rumors I had heard. Fantastical wild
tales; but who is to say what lies outside possibility when the
Sun has fallen, and Night outlasts the year?</p>

<p>‘It was rumored the Sleepers would awaken, once the Sun
returned. And there was only one path to that end.</p>

<p>‘I gave no thought to the bandits, or that they might waste
their time in tracking me. And yet that is what they did. The
thieves turned soldier in hunting me. It was they, reached me at
last here in your wood.</p>

<p>‘But I burned with seeking for my enemy, and paid no heed
to them. I searched in the east, in Europe, England, Scotland,
Wales. Now I know he is not far from here. He came to Ireland
Imbolc Moon.</p>

<p>‘In the name of my love and for her sake, tell me now if
you have heard of this one, Mablaith’s own countryman and my
enemy. He it was, they say, unbound the girdle of light and
waked the Unappeasable Host. It was by his doing Mablaith was
put asleep, and only by his death, they say, will Day return to
waken her.</p>

<p>‘Tell me if you have heard of Master Aengus and where he
may be found, for I have sworn an oath upon this lock of
Mablaith’s hair that I will kill him, put an end to Night and
summon back the Sun.’</p>

<h2><a name="ch12"></a> 12. How She Learned of Him</h2>

<p class="first">IN THE SHALLOWS the fish-girls swam and played.
One said, ‘It’s cold the Sea is now. Shouldn’t the Sun be
warming it? Has Aengus not fulfilled his lady’s bidding?’</p>

<p>‘He never meant to,’ said the other.</p>

<p>‘Not Aengus! Let’s learn what became of him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I still don’t know what it has to do with us,’
grumbled the third.</p>

<p>The three fishes swam back into the West, to the isle beneath
the water. On the sea-floor they found the body of Master
Aengus, all rough and charred from burning.</p>

<p>The fish-girls tugged and tugged, and they bore dead Aengus
on their backs, in the long streams of their drowning hair,
beneath the Imbolc Moon.</p>

<p>‘Where to leave him now?’ asked the second fish.</p>

<p>‘Not here! I hear a frightful thirteen steps upon the sand,
to and fro, like a clock.’</p>

<p>‘It’s far the nearest, and my back hurts,’ grumbled the
third.</p>

<p>So the fish-girls took Aengus up the coast, outside of
Inishark and Inishbofin, and curved inside of Inishturk into the
river at the flood. Past the water-change they left the body, on
a bank of weeds and reeds.</p>

<p>To the frogs and herons on the bank the fish-girls said,</p>

<p>‘Let you go now over the hills to the lady and have her
send her bandits, for there is one here having need of her, and
it’s only she by her art can restore him.’</p>

<p>And when the Sea ran out so did the three fish-girls, and the
body hung high up on the weeds, drying and black against the
silver halo of the moon.</p>

<p class="break">IN THE HONEY HALL a silence fell after the
Breton told his tale. For a long while no one was answering his
question, concerning Master Aengus. The trees, half-drunken, had
long since stopped listening. Agatha sat very still. Mielusine
blushed so deeply the red of it suffused her breasts beneath her
gown.</p>

<p>‘The man you speak of,’ she said at last, ‘—what was
his name, now?’</p>

<p>‘The devil,’ answered Eudemarec, ‘named him Master
Aengus.’</p>

<p>‘And it was he, you say – one man alone, brought an end
to the Day? But why?’</p>

<p>‘It’s said lust for a woman drove him on to it.’</p>

<p>‘That may well be – that may well be,’ stammered
Mielusine. ‘But we are alone in this wood. And I cannot say
that I ever heard of this man. Nor have any of us here—’</p>

<p>‘Nay, I know him,’ said Agatha.</p>

<p>The Breton looked on her – looked on the sparkle in her
eye, the color in her cheek, and the bitter hunger in her
mouth.</p>

<p>‘What have you heard of him?’</p>

<p>‘That he was a poor free farmer, dared woo a lord’s young
lady. He had no power to enrich the fields, but his one
philosophy was to blaspheme against God and set a woman in His
place. So he ended the world to win her, and it was a cold
portion he got for his pains. Where he is now I do not know, but
for a time he was holding the lady prisoner in Ballynoe, in
County Cork not far from the banks of the Bride, so you might
look there to start.’</p>

<p>The Breton’s eyes took shine. ‘Ballynoe, do you say now?
In County Cork?’</p>

<p>‘Aye, hard put to by the river Bride.’</p>

<p>Mielusine put out the trees, and went to bed herself. But all
through that darkness Lady Agatha and the Breton sat up
speaking; he was asking, she answering.</p>

<p>And as soon as ever she could next moonrise, Mielusine drew
Agatha apart, asking, was it true? ‘Was it Master Aengus, put
out the Sun?’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha looked at the maid. Mielusine had never seen her
so alive and proud. ‘Aye,’ she answered, ‘it was he.’</p>

<p>‘And it was for you he did all that?’</p>

<p>‘Nay, now: he did it for himself.’</p>

<p class="break">AFTERWARD there was not the same closeness
between the Maid and Lady Agatha as there had been before.
Mielusine was left alone with Eudemarec, and that was for the
best.</p>

<p>In the wood the Maid and the Breton were gathering mushrooms,
spied on by the trees. Little enough work the trees were doing,
but only such as to win the Maid’s attention. Eudemarec
laughed when he saw them peeping; at that their faces ran brown
with sap, knotting up in squints.</p>

<p>Agatha left the lovers and went down outside the wood, and
walked the length of the hedge encircling it. And at every hole
in the hedge she stopped and glared at it, muttering binding
words, ‘Let her not be passing out through you, unless it’s
the two of us as one.’</p>

<p>Now as to Mielusine, she was more full of herself than ever
in the highwayman’s eyes. She could not help but be trying her
new arts on him. The Breton smiled at her, and treated her
courteously; but elsewise there was no whit of the earnestness
Lady Agatha had told her of.</p>

<p>He plucked up a wide flat mushroom and showed it to her. She
thought he was standing rather close. Nervously she moved apart;
he moved with her, coming closer still; reached out of a sudden
and brushed back a tangled wisp of her black hair, whispering,
‘Mielusine!’</p>

<p>She started and skipped back; Eudemarec leaned against a tree
and laughed. ‘Don’t you know,’ he said, ‘this is the
Beltane Moon? That sport you’re playing, Mielusine, it’s no
sport to be playing,’ he said, ‘unless you are ready to
win.’</p>

<p class="break">THE DARK MOON rose, and the silver Moon fell.
The tides of the Sea swarmed in the darkness all black, and out
to sea beneath the waves something red shining darkly, gleaming
now with this swell and now with that: and that thing was the
Sun, buried deep beneath the bottom of the Sea by the cursing of
Master Aengus, that was dead now, and hung in the silver reeds
above the tide.</p>

<p>And while Master Aengus hung in the silver reeds dead, a
faint dim dream occurred to him.</p>

<p>He dreamt a shadowy woman in white was lifting him down and
laying him on the grass. And she stroked his hair and pressed
her mouth to his, and brought him back to life.</p>

<p>That was the dream that came to the dead man. But outwardly
there was no sign of it in his still gaunt black body.</p>

<p>Now, out of the bushes on the braes above the river, a timid
beast came down, and looked on the man’s form caught among the
reeds. It was a small white hind, and two horns were emerging
out of her head, and round her neck was clasped a torc of
gold.</p>

<p>The White Hind sniffed at the sea-wet clothes of the man, and
licked a little at his salty hand.</p>

<p>And from a hill over the river valley a dark man stood out
from behind a tree. He was wearing a dark gray cóta mór. In
his hand he held a bow, and quickly he strung it, nocked an
arrow in its string, and drew an aim on the beast.</p>

<p>But the White Hind started at a sudden sound. Down the valley
rode a riding-band, and she darted away.</p>

<p>The horses beat nearer. Their riders were so many robbers and
jades, come hunting Master Aengus. And they a wild-looking,
splendid, throat-slitting bunch, clad in broad-brimmed hats and
silver spurs, and heavy riding cloaks, and scarlet riding cloaks
adorned with the black letter <i>A</i> and black riding cloaks
embroidered with that same letter <i>A</i> in scarlet, too. They
cut him down with their scians and made a bier for him, and
bound up his body in reeds and in sedge. They took the bundle of
his parchments the fish-girls had left at the side of him.</p>

<p>And the riders wheeled their ponies and their stallions round
about, laughing and discharging silver pistols into the clouds
for sport, aiming at stars between the gaps of clouds. And they
rode themselves away up-country, and they carried the dead man
far away, to the white shining abbey dreamt up in the mist.</p>

<p>At the edge of the bay the dark man watched them go. He
unstrung his bow, and put up his pack again across his thin bony
shoulder, and he followed after the robbers’ trail.</p>

<p class="break">SOME MOONS LATER, a bit of warmth came seeping
out of the deep places in the earth.</p>

<p>Behind the thick black hedge, inside the dark close wood, in
the Honey Hall, Eudemarec the Breton felt his strength rising
back into himself, and his arms ready to gripe and grasp, and
his legs ready to stride and stroll. And in the presence of the
Maid he felt some of his wounds come round well again; little
did he guess that was the work of Agatha, that sang little songs
of healing over him whenever he lay himself down to sleep.</p>

<p>And one dark of the moon, Agatha bent low across the Breton
in his bed, and breathed out a secret little song, so that the
perfume of her breath entered fragrant within his
broad-spreading nostrils, and he caught his breath and almost
woke, although she would not let him. And the song of her went
softly and simply into his heart,</p>

<blockquote>
  <i>Master Aengus,<br>
  Master Aengus,<br>
  Master Aengus waits for you.</i></blockquote>

<p class="break">THE DARK MOON was rising again, and Agatha woke
and rose from her spot on the floor before the Maid’s bed. She
saw the other bed was void, and she stepped out of the door.</p>

<p>At the end of the glade the Breton was standing, looking at
the Moon.</p>

<p>‘Let her bless you,’ said Agatha.</p>

<p>He stayed looking out into the sky, and it was as if he did
not hear. But after a space he breathed, and asked,</p>

<p>‘How big is the Night-land do you think, and how many
moons’ riding, between this place and Ballynoe in County Cork,
hard put to by the banks of the Bride?’</p>

<p>Then Agatha smiled a little bitter smile. <i>Yes</i>, she
thought, <i>he heard me even so</i>.</p>

<p>‘It is far and wide,’ she answered him, by way of testing
him.</p>

<p>‘And how old will I be, when at last I might be reaching
it?’</p>

<p>‘As old as you will be at that time,’ she answered, ‘if
you stayed here in this place instead.’</p>

<p>Eudemarec made ready to be setting out again. And to her
surprise Lady Agatha, too, found herself restless to be going,
restless to be doing. Maid Mielusine saw it in them both, and
sighed; she had no great urging to be off away from her home
there.</p>

<p>One moon Agatha went off to the pond to wash the linens;
Eudemarec took his horse away riding. Maid Mielusine went about
her affairs and tended to her trees, and tended to her hut, and
tended to the animals coming to her byre. Alone she was, in the
rising of the moon; alone she was in its falling. And there was
no sign nor sight of Eudemarec, nor of Agatha either.</p>

<p>That moon Mielusine kept her stew waiting a good long time,
enduring the trees’ grumbling, to wait for the Breton and the
lady, and they neither of them showing their faces at the door.
At moonfall Mielusine went herself to the pond. Where she found
the heap of linens by the water, and the tracks of the
Breton’s horse, and naught else.</p>

<p>Mielusine sighed. She knew what had befallen.</p>

<p>‘It was the lady, for all her rags, Eudemarec better liked;
and now they two are gone away together, and I am left
alone.’</p>

<p>She went and sat herself down on one of Owen’s roots.</p>

<p>The next moon rose, and that moon fell, and her grieving only
worsened. It was a worse loss even than the loss of her sisters
she was feeling.</p>

<p><i>Gone now is my beauty, gone now my fortune, gone my
friend, and they are all gone. With them went Mielusine the
lady, Mielusine Master Aengus’ love. What is left? Only
Mielusine the cottager’s daughter, the little pinch-faced
Sini.</i></p>

<p class="break">NOW, WHEN Eudemarec rode his horse to the pond
where Agatha bent to her washing, he let his horse wander, and
himself stood speaking to her. She did little to encourage him,
and was answering hardly at all.</p>

<p>He was telling her of the world of Night.</p>

<p>‘Now some, accounted dream-eyed in the daylit world, thrive
and do great things; and others, once mighty, now are as beggars
by the way.’ And he told her of the many gentle cities were
a-building, in places overlooked by day.</p>

<p>‘Why, there are whole cities in the mountains of the Rhine,
and a mist maunders over them, and you cannot reach even half a
league near to the walls of them. Every living soul, man and
woman, child, horse, and dog, lies deep in the unwakeable Sleep.
There are strange towers built over the dry fields deep in
France, and they are pressing the grape there as if it were the
flesh of Bacchus reborn they are crushing into wine.’</p>

<p>Agatha wrung out a cloth, scratched back the thick tangle of
her dirty hair. Eudemarec took a stone and skipped it out across
the pond; still she would not answer.</p>

<p>‘Then again, below the mountains,’ he went on, ‘I saw
white-clad priests in Rome, bowing on the rooftops of basilicas,
praying to the Black Sun, the Moon’s half brother.</p>

<p>‘In Spain the priests are sleeping: a Counter-Inquisition
is on foot, and they are raising the Horned God. In the palace
of the kings of France peasants walk about barefoot, making love
in marble halls before the gilded doors of slumbering nobles.
Beautiful harlots in Paris are hailed as once Empresses were in
Rome.’</p>

<p>Agatha took a stone, and stroked it back and forth upon one
of his shirts, worrying at a stain. The Breton fetched him up a
sigh.</p>

<p>‘How strange it is, then, that only here in this small
forest would I be finding word of my enemy. And I had not even
entered here but for the simplest chance.’</p>

<p>She stopped at that, and fixed his eye. ‘What pointed you
here?’ she wondered.</p>

<p>‘Why, a woman on the road pointed the way, saying here was
surely someone who could help me.’</p>

<p>She frowned. ‘A woman!’ she exclaimed. ‘And was it a
lady, dressed in the height of fashion?’</p>

<p>‘No, now: it was a countrywoman old in her rags.’</p>

<p>Agatha returned to her washing, and he continued in his
musings. ‘The strangest place I found, was here in this land:
in a lough of mists there is a land, and there I found another
lough, where the Lady Arianna has conjured up her white
abbey.’</p>

<p>‘I have never heard of her,’ said Lady Agatha.</p>

<p>‘Ah, but you should have done! There are wonders in her
court. Once, far across the lough in the dark of the moon, I
even caught a glimpse of the lady herself, shimmering on the
water.</p>

<p>‘All her bandits and trollops followed after her. Behind
her went her three maids, and at her side walked her champion. A
bit apart walked another, in a plain coat and breeches. There is
a strange tale hangs about him, and later I met and spoke with
him.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha cast down the linens and sighed. ‘Amuse me
then, Eudemarec, if you must pester me. Tell me of the
man.’</p>

<p>‘Well, he is somewhat above the common height, and lean.
There is something in his eye – he is always searching for a
thing he claims he lost; and he spoke of strange things such as
no other man would think of.</p>

<p>‘He is called Arianna’s Bacach. And indeed he is lame in
one leg. <i>Bacach</i> means lame in your speech, does it
not?’</p>

<p>‘It is generally the meaning of folk when they say it,’
she answered, turning back to her washing.</p>

<p>‘They say in the night of No Moon after Imbolc, river-frogs
and herons hopped up to the lough, and called to the lady in
croaks and screeches and howls. Then the lady sent her bandits
to the river, and they came back with the man.</p>

<p>‘He was dead, or very near it. Arianna labored over him
many a moon, and brought him back to health.</p>

<p>‘They say he had gone on a geis set upon him by a woman,
into the Western Sea. And there below the waves he struggled to
summon back the Sun; but of course he found only his own death
when he set out from these shores.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha turned on him sharply. <i>Aengus</i>, cried her
heart. <i>Master Aengus is that man!</i> But aloud she was
saying, ‘This cannot be true, what you say. Admit it, sir: it
is a lie.’</p>

<p>‘By Mablaith, it is the truth I tell you!’</p>

<p>‘Go on then, describe this man to me,’ said Agatha.
‘Were his hands long, with knuckles round as quail’s eggs,
and sparse black hairs growing upon the backs, like reeds bent
by the wind? Did he have a gap in his right eyebrow, where a
pale scar ran? And was there a lock of white hair grown out in
his dark locks above his left ear?’</p>

<p>‘You know him then, my lady. It is the very man.’</p>

<p>‘I know his double! But did he wear a chain about his neck,
holding a golden guinea?’</p>

<p>‘No – but he wore a chaplet of laurel that the lady
herself had put upon him, the way they said, laurel is the
poet’s gold, as much as the blessing of the dead, and the rare
right word.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me then, Eudemarec: you said he spoke of strange
things. What things? Did he speak to the Moon as though he knew
her secret name?’</p>

<p>‘He did that,’ said the Breton with a laugh.</p>

<p>‘And did he claim to know what lay at the back of the winds
when they ran, and what things the grass-stalks sang, when the
Moon goes down? And had he seen the sky beyond the Sun and
Moon?’</p>

<p>‘As I say, this Bacach was a man of wisdom.’</p>

<p>‘And did he not speak of a lady he loved. Did he not tell
of how he longed for her and wronged her. Did he not tell you
how he lost her, and braved what no other man had braved, to win
her back – in vain? And did he not speak her name?’</p>

<p>Eudemarec considered, and shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Lady, compose yourself,’ he said. ‘Yes, his words ran
along some such lines. He was searching for one, and he said he
would give his life to gain her back, and repair the wrong. That
he would never see her again. And that knowledge cut his heart
to the roots.’</p>

<p>‘Yes … yes,’ said Agatha. She turned away, to hide her
face away from him. <i>Let no man see me in the weakness of my
need</i>, she thought.</p>

<p>‘But it was not a woman he spoke of,’ said Eudemarec.</p>

<p>She turned back.</p>

<p>‘No,’ he said again. ‘Rather it was a white hind he had
wounded.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha took his arm. ‘What is this you say,’ she
asked, ‘—a hind?’</p>

<p>‘He had searched the world for her, but hadn’t found her.
Oh, he went on and on about the hind. He never spoke of any
woman. Unless by the hind he meant a lady?’</p>

<p>‘It cannot be true,’ said Agatha. ‘It must be a
lie.’</p>

<p>She sat and held her head between her hands. She hardly
heeded him.</p>

<p>‘It seems you knew this man,’ Eudemarec said at length.
‘Pardon me if what I said distressed you. Maybe I should be
leaving you now. But it’s the first time we two have been
alone apart from the Maid. And it’s almost well I am now; soon
I’ll be going. But I would not go alone.’</p>

<p>‘Ask then,’ she said through her hands. ‘You’d know
what it is Maid Mielusine is whispering to me in your
regard?’</p>

<p>‘No, Agatha. I’d know rather what it is you are
whispering to her.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha uttered a bleak, mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>‘What, now?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Oh Eudemarec! Don’t you see the comedy in it? – That
between the beauty and the one in rags whose hair hangs like
river-weeds, you should choose me?’</p>

<p>‘Your maid is fair as Day, but this is Night. Your quality
gleams through your rags. Why do you hide? I know your wild
heart all the same.’</p>

<p>‘Do you, now?’</p>

<p>He stood up over her, close and near, so that the warmth of
his body was strong as arms embracing her. ‘We have both known
passion, you and I. We have both betrayed what was dear to us.
Our loves are waiting in the Day. But we need not wait alone.
Let us join hands.’</p>

<p>She swept back her skirts from him.</p>

<p>‘But you don’t know!’ she mocked. ‘You met him face
to face, and you don’t even know it!’</p>

<p>He looked at her, a blank look; her laughter stung him,
stronger now than ever.</p>

<p>‘Would you know then, what sort of man is this Bacach?
Would you be knowing the place of your enemy, and mine? It’s
there where you found him! They are the same, those two. The
Bacach is Master Aengus, Eudemarec!’</p>

<p>‘No,’ he breathed.</p>

<p>‘Moy-rua, yes! And it’s this Bacach who loosed the girdle
of the Sun and doomed the Day, and it’s himself who left your
Mablaith to languish unto death!’</p>

<h2><a name="ch13"></a> 13. How the Trees Were Stilled</h2>

<p class="first">LATE IN THE DARKNESS of that moon, at last,
Maid Mielusine ladled out her cooking to her trees. Herself, she
ate no part of it.</p>

<p>She sat in the hob seat in the hearth and looked into the
embers burning out. Maid Mielusine fell quiet, bending in upon
herself. <i>They are gone now</i>, she saying to herself, over
and over and over again. <i>Prince Eudemarec has taken Lady
Agatha away, and they two are gone now beyond the hedge out of
this wood, out into the Night-land broad.</i></p>

<p>The trees grew louder and coarser than ever, if that was
possible. They weren’t sorry at all those two had gone.
Mielusine was theirs again, and no one else would claim her:
no!</p>

<p>And they fell to boasting amongst themselves, who of them
would prove her best guardsman.</p>

<p>‘It’s me!’ shouted Neil. ‘I’ll be her best
protector!’</p>

<p>‘I’ll be letting nobody near her!’ shouted Sean.</p>

<p>And Griff and Sean and Neil they were towering out from the
benches, and butting crowns amongst the rafters, knocking up a
frightful din, the others shouting them on, shoving forward and
back.</p>

<p>Maid Mielusine on the hob by the hearth bent her head,
glaring at them. The trees weren’t looking often her way, the
way her looks for them were so very mad.</p>

<p>All at once she leapt up: caught a firebrand from the hearth,
swinging it, shouting ‘Leave! Leave! Leave!’</p>

<p>Mielusine flung the door shut on them; she was tearing off
the white gown, digging in her chest for her homespun clothes.
But her eyes were falling on the slumbering red gown, and she
was feeling how unfair all of it was.</p>

<p>Again and again she was regretting being shy with Eudemarec.
Again and again she was taken with thoughts of how pleasant it
would have been to have been <i>kissed</i> by him: to be
<i>kissed</i> by any man at all! The thought of it started
something burning up in her, dreadful and fine. And all alone
she was curling up on the hearthstones in the glow of the fire,
and wishing in her misery to be sleeping endlessly, ignorant of
the world.</p>

<p><i>I must be rising soon</i>, she was dreaming in herself at
last. <i>The way it must be moonrise already, and my animals in
the byre hungry and lone</i>. But she did not move.</p>

<p>At last she was hearing a sound at the door, and Mielusine
saw someone standing there, half shadow, shining through the
damp veil of her tears.</p>

<p>‘Am I dreaming now,’ Mielusine was whispering, ‘or is
it truly you?’</p>

<p>The figure reached out its arms, beckoning.</p>

<p>‘Mielusine!’ the figure called.</p>

<p>‘Mielusine, Eudemarec is gone, he bore me to the hedge at
the edge of the wood but I couldn’t go farther with him. He
knows where Master Aengus is now, Mielusine, and is gone to kill
him. It was I told him where to find him!</p>

<p>‘And now I cannot keep away, but it draws me like adamant,
I must be going there, but my thoughts are running, round and
round – Mielusine, it’s that you must be coming with me, or
I will be falling dead in a ditch along the road even if I could
be getting out of here. Will you, Mielusine? Will you come with
me after Eudemarec, and keep him from killing Master
Aengus?’</p>

<p>The Maid crawled to her feet. She was leaning back against
the hearth, her hand half raised. In her belly it was hollow, as
though she had been struck there. The tips of her breasts
against the coarse wool of her kirtle were burning, burning.
Then she answered,</p>

<p>‘Surely I’ll go with you, Agatha. Weren’t we planning
it all along? He’s going to Master Aengus? Take me along with
you.’</p>

<p>And Lady Agatha filled a corna with goat’s cream and drank
of it, and offered it to the maid.</p>

<p>‘Drink,’ she said, ‘and finish it.’</p>

<p>Mielusine turned the corna round, to the white kiss on the
rim where the lady had drank, and pressed her lips to the very
spot, drinking and feeling the lady’s eyes looking that deep
into hers.</p>

<p>Outside the Honey Hall, the moon and her Night-land they were
beckoning them. And they went out of the hall, those women, and
slipped away into the Night.</p>

<p class="break">AS TO THE TREES, they were hiding themselves
out of shame and suffering in the dug-up glade where Conn killed
Owen. They were standing there, bent over among the lifeless
trees. And their thoughts were running in the same stream-bed,
and it’s sad and lonely they were, and worried for the
maid.</p>

<p>And their branches were creaking in the chill night’s
wind.</p>

<p><i>What is wrong with Maid Mielusine?</i> creaked the
branches of this one. <i>Why don’t she come deck us with
flowers and straw rings as she used?</i></p>

<p><i>It’s all Agatha’s fault</i>, creaked the branches of
that one. <i>She’s ugly. I hate her! How did we ever take her
for a lady, now?</i></p>

<p><i>Mielusine loves her. And besides, she made her the lovely
white gown, and transfigured her.</i></p>

<p>They all were sighing the same sad song, twisting back toward
the hall where herself, as they thought, lay dreaming.</p>

<p><i>You knot-heads, let her char you all! What’s the matter
with you now?</i> broke in one sharply as the snapping of a
limb. <i>It’s not with you she’s wanting to play! Moy-rua,
can’t you see Miss Mielusine’s a lady now herself?</i></p>

<p>There was stillness in the glade after that. Only the chill
wind soughing and sighing in the branches of the dead trees. The
eight friends waited, but it was in vain, the way Maid Mielusine
wasn’t coming round to find them and shoo them all home for a
good hot meal. Come the next darkness they crept back to the
hall – they had to.</p>

<p>They reached the clearing. They looked squinting across to
the hall. The door was open wide, and the gate of the byre was
open too, and Mielusine’s pets were gone. It was dark in the
hall, and still.</p>

<p>The trees crept closer. There was no sound within, and fear
was all but curling up their rooty toes.</p>

<p>Inside the hall they found it empty and cold, and bed-clothes
and cups scattered about, all tri-na-chiele. But in the dirt
outside the door, in a curve round the base of the bird-pool
they eight had made, white stones spelled the words,</p>

<p class="center">FARE<br>
WELL</p>

<p>They stared at those stones, at those marks left in the dirt.
But long as they stared, the words would not be transforming
themselves into any better news than that.</p>

<p>‘She’s gone, she is,’ groaned Griff, after a good long
while. ‘Maid Mielusine is gone.’</p>

<p>‘Will she be returning, now,’ wondered Neil.</p>

<p>‘It was Conn drove her away,’ said Ted. That was the
start of another quarrel between them, the worst one yet, and it
ended when they all broke away, and trudged down the hill on
different paths. But each in his own path was slowing and
stiffening.</p>

<p>It was Maid Mielusine had charmed them into life. Now
Mielusine was gone.</p>

<p>And in the end they stopped altogether, near the hedge at the
ends of the wood. Separately they closed their knotty eyes,
bending back their arms in the most comfortable way. Their faces
were blending back into bark. Their toes were sinking into the
warm ground, holding them in place. Drowsy they were, and
falling asleep, sleep such as trees know that live hundreds of
years, the unquick life of trees.</p>

<p>But just before he stopped entirely, and the wood in him
stiffened into its old hardness forever, and the rough bark
crusted over the features of his face, then at that moment every
tree sighed, a sigh as soft and plaintive as the old wind
through the branches of the naked midwinter twilight. And he
prayed in his last sigh, ‘Do not lose sight of me utterly,
Maid Mielusine, but remember me from time to time.’</p>

<p>‘Remember me,’ sighed Barry, and</p>

<p>‘Remember me,’ sighed Griff.</p>

<p>‘Remember me,’ sighed Neil, while far away across the
wood,</p>

<p>‘Remember me,’ sighed Will, and</p>

<p>‘Remember me,’ sighed Ted, while Tadgh sighed far
away,</p>

<p>‘Remember me.’</p>

<p>‘Remember me,’ sighed How.</p>

<p>‘Remember me,’ sighed Conn.</p>

<p>Conn was the last of them, the last of them still quick in
their slow woody way, and Conn’s sighing was the last of all
their magic, dying in a wide ring round the half-burnt wood.
They moved no more, nor spoke, nor sang, nor dug, nor drank.
They were no more than trees. Do trees drink or dance?</p>

<p>And from then onward there was nothing to tell them from
their burned brethren, but the one thing:</p>

<p>From the splinters of his crown, from the knot once a nose,
from onetime fingertips, each of those eight was sprouting
tender shoots, so pale in the moonlight they might have been
gold.</p>

<p class="break">MAID MIELUSINE was walking alongside Lady
Agatha down the path.</p>

<p>And Lady Agatha was saying, ‘It was at the pond I told him.
“Is it true?” he asks me. His horse is nearby; in an instant
he’s mounted, and drawing me up behind him. And we’re
riding, and the branches shooting past, down this very path. But
at the wood’s edge we reach the hole in the hedge, when all of
a sudden the hedge-claws push against me, and light me down on
the moss. Eudemarec rides on through, stops his steed and whirls
it round.</p>

<p>‘And he calls, “Come on, Agatha! Come riding with
me!”</p>

<p>‘I leap after him, but again the hedge won’t let me pass.
Oh, for the curse of too much wisdom! My own cleverness
defeating me, the way I was casting a spell across the hedge not
to be letting you leave without me, lest the Breton carry you
off; but the hedge loves you, and won’t let me go alone
either, lest you be trapped in the wood behind.</p>

<p>‘I groan and call to him, “I cannot go farther,
man!”&nbsp;’</p>

<p>‘&nbsp;“No?” he asks me. Och, you should have seen the man!
There’s a mad gleaming in his eye, and he making his horse to
dance. Holiness is taking hold of him, the purity of vengeance,
and he handsome as never before.</p>

<p>Again he asks me: “No? Then bide you here, my sweetest,
grimmest Agatha: and I’ll bring you Master Aengus’ head in a
basket!” And he rides away. He rides so fast, he must be
halfway to the Sea by now!’</p>

<p>‘He will not really hurt Master Aengus?’ asked Mielusine
after a bit.</p>

<p>‘Wasn’t he a cut-throat now, on the edge of Broceliande?
Didn’t he learn of sword-cutting and pistol-shot from the
finest dueling-masters in Nantes? Master Aengus is no soldier,
Mielusine.’</p>

<p>The path was widening, the starry fields shining through.
Already they could see the dense wall of the hedge, broken at
the path’s end in the way of a gate.</p>

<p>Mielusine slowed her step.</p>

<p>‘Come on, now,’ urged Lady Agatha.</p>

<p>Mielusine was looking back. She wasn’t wanting to be
leaving. Too soon it was coming, the moment she must be bidding
farewell to this place.</p>

<p>She looked up, about and back again. The black trees were so
comforting! A sudden pang was striking her: <i>My trees now,
where are they, what will they do?</i></p>

<p>‘Come along, we must be hurrying,’ said Agatha. Mielusine
looked down, at the claw of the lady, pulling on her arm.</p>

<p>And ahead through the fine weave of the hedge and blackened
branches was shining the tip of the arc of the Moon: dreamlike
it was, and reminding her somehow of Aengus.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she breathed, ‘you are right. We must be
hurrying.’</p>

<p>And the two women slipped out through the hedge, and on the
gleaming road took up Eudemarec’s trail into the heart of
Ireland.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14"></a>14. Of the Each Dubh</h2>

<p class="first">THEY WERE WALKING now, walking through the
Night. Summer had come round again, cool and belated, but an end
to the snow at least. There was a stillness swallowing the
Night-land, and only their steps on the road were cracking,
loudly, like grain brayed in a mortar.</p>

<p>‘Och, this silence!’ cried Agatha one moon. ‘It’s mad
it’s driving me, the way only my mad thoughts are filling it,
all about Aengus, and madness, and death. Sing, Mielusine, will
you please?’</p>

<p>‘What could I be singing, against this great high ceiling
of stars and black clouds?’ asked the Maid.</p>

<p>‘It matters nothing, as to that: only sing. Sing a cradle
song, sing something, sing nonsense sounds, so you sing away
this crying in my self!’</p>

<p>Then Maid Mielusine took pity on her friend; she lowered her
head, and thought; and after a moment, along with the crunch of
their footsteps, the maid’s voice, wavering as a child’s,
went out into that airy vastness. She sang songs she had learned
of her mother at the cradle, she sang songs for washing and for
work, and for resting by the evening fire.</p>

<p>That would have been Midsummer Eve in Day, and they wandering
through a county burning with bonfires and the laughing of
gentle folk. Overhead the sky drew across itself a covering in a
muslin of cloud, breaking at times, showing the Moon. A chaplet
of primroses wreathed the Moon, shivering like Mielusine’s
voice.</p>

<p class="break">THE NEXT MOONRISE they found a post-house
beside a bank of rowans. Abandoned it seemed, but for a dim glow
in the window.</p>

<p>An old man was waiting inside. He welcomed them in with a
fine fialte; his name he gave as Connor; and he was so quaint
and foolish-wise, Mielusine soon loved him. ‘No questions
now,’ said he: ‘Eat, drink, be warm by my fire! Mary bless
such travelers as you, to fill the empty hours!’</p>

<p>‘We are looking for a Breton, must have passed this way,’
said Lady Agatha. ‘Do you know what way he took? He was bound
for the abbey of Arianna, wherever that may be.’</p>

<p>‘Is that where he’s headed now? Aye, I know him,’ said
Connor. ‘Was in a fearful hurry he was. But he took the long
road to be going to the mist. If he’d deigned to speak with a
man, I might have set him right.’</p>

<p>‘Which way? We must be catching him.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, settle yourself, girl!’ he said.</p>

<p>He bent over the fire, reddening the tobacco in his dudeen.
‘I can set you on a way, will have you there in half the time
he’ll take. I’ll even lend you a horse to be beating him.
But for this you must be paying me – no coins, now! For it’s
the love I have of travelers’ tales, and now that I alone am
running the place, with no interference of others, it’s the
only currency I’ll take!’</p>

<p>‘Then it’s a grand tale I’ll be giving you,’ Lady
Agatha said. And then and there she set out a tale of how she
and Mielusine had come to the post-house; a tale full of lost
loves, duels and perilous flights: a tale worthy of her beloved
novel, and not a word of it true. Maid Mielusine sat agape at
it, but Connor listened with not a blink of his eye.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said at last, puffing on his dudeen. ‘Well,
well! Girl, this is the fanciest tale I ever yet heard. And are
you sure you’ve got it all straight, now?’</p>

<p>And he laughed, and Agatha joined him.</p>

<p>‘So you’ve told me one,’ he said, ‘let me tell you
another! Did you ever hear of the Man Who Should Have
Slept?’</p>

<p>He smiled at their frowns, and spat into the fire.</p>

<p>‘Och, ’tis the strangest tale! It was himself, sitting
there across from me at this very table, told me the tale! He
came from a far kingdom across the seas, and in the last
evenings of the Day, he alone saw the spot growing on the face
of the Sun, and knew what that betokened.</p>

<p>‘He knew, you see, the Night was coming, and he knew, too,
that he was meant to be one of the Sleepers. But he knew how to
fight against the Sleep, and he willed himself awake. And he
alone, out of all the Sleepers, stayed awake in the Night,
though at a cost – a dear cost, I can tell you, having seen
the grisly grim eye in his dead gray face. I could have reached
out and touched it myself, the man was as close to me as
that!</p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ said Connor, leaning over the table and
lowering his voice, though no one was about: ‘Did you never
wonder, why was it we woke, while so many others are Sleeping?
I’ll tell you. We are all of a kind, we Wakeful. Unspoken
words, more secret even than the freemasons’, bind us all as
one.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, it was an accident, sure, and no more than that,’
Lady Agatha said. ‘Listen, stage-keeper, if you like tales so
much. Do you want to know why the Night fell, and what man
brought all this on our heads?’</p>

<p>‘Och, you’ll not be telling me the old tale of our Master
Aengus and his lady, will you girl? There are half a dozen
stories more amusing than his. Everyone’s heard of him; but
who can tell where he ended, and where his lady is? And what’s
the good of a tale without a proper ending?’</p>

<p>She stared at him.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’ve heard many a better tale,’ he went on. ‘And
here’s the one I like best. It was no one man woke the
Unappeasable Host, as what one man could? – but it was the
groaning and the prayers of us all – all us Wakeful, now. We
in our hearts, beaten down with taxes, press-gangs, and the
heaping-up of laws, we all were calling them out. And now
we’ve only so much Night to cut loose the reins of the world,
ere the blessed dawn break and all the Sleepers wake! It’s
them are sleeping, but us dreaming the new world up over their
heads, and before they waken, why it’ll be done!’</p>

<p>‘What will the new world be like, Mr Connor?’ asked
Mielusine.</p>

<p>‘Ah. Ah, now. ’Twill be a world,’ he answered, puffing
with all solemnity, ‘where the past will be dead, clean
uprooted from the earth. It will be a world where what a fellow
holds in his hand and what he holds in his head will not be the
same, but what’s in his head will be worth more! It will be
the world of all Desiring, and Reaching, and Pleasure. ’Twill
be the world of our own making, Miss. We’ve but to dream for
it.’</p>

<p>Mielusine said, ‘Someone’s spying on us.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, now,’ said Connor, ‘Here’s Siobhan.’</p>

<p>A young woman emerged from the shadows at the back of the
house.</p>

<p>She was dark and graceful, and pretty, the way she was biting
her lip. She wore a dark woolen dress with a long dark shawl,
and her black hair was spilling out in a mass of unruly ringlets
halfway down to her knees. Her eyes were dark, narrow, and
odd.</p>

<p>‘Let her bless you,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>‘Wasn’t I telling you?’ Connor asked with a snort of a
laugh. ‘Where else but in the Night would a wild young maid be
burning up her time with an old gentleman such as myself?’</p>

<p>She took his hand and kissed it. ‘It’s that you tell the
grandest tales,’ she murmured.</p>

<p>Mielusine reached out and laid the palm of her hand across
the woman’s lower belly. Siobhan held Mielusine’s hand
there, and laughed.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it grand?’ she asked, shaking her head and
looking sideways at Connor. ‘It was during this Night he was
conceived.’</p>

<p class="break">COME MOONRISE Connor took them to the stable,
and brought them out a horse.</p>

<p>And black was that horse; tall, great of body, too. Only his
eyes could be properly seen, gleaming red, and the splash of a
star on his forehead, moving against the clouds.</p>

<p>‘Here is my joy,’ breathed Connor.</p>

<p>‘He is a miracle,’ murmured Agatha. ‘How comes it that
you, in this post-house, keep a horse worthy of a sultan?’</p>

<p>‘Did I not tell you, we’ve only to dream? It was Porter
found me as much as ever I did him. Steady, girl! You both must
ride him, for no other horse could match him! He’ll take no
saddle nor bridle, but if you hang on, and whisper in his ear,
he’ll bear you smooth as a Lughnasadh wind.’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha climbed on the each dubh easily, but the Maid
hung back. ‘He’s wild, I’ll fall and die,’ she
whispered.</p>

<p>‘Let you take hold of my arm and climb up,’ commanded
Lady Agatha. ‘Mr Connor, help her – put up your skirts,
Mielusine, grip him with your ankles and your knees. Wreathe
your arms about my waist; I’ve a mind to see how fast he
is!’</p>

<p>‘Moy-rua, let him choose his own pace,’ said Connor.
‘But you now, it’s a deoch an dorrus you must be drinking,
to speed you on your way. Here’s the corna now, and be
drinking down to its bottom. Isn’t it my own poteen, that
warmer than porter, that warmer than mead?’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha swallowed down the burning hot liquor, and the
three of them, Agatha, Connor, and Siobhan, made Mielusine empty
the corna too, though she was unwilling.</p>

<p>‘And when,’ said Connor, ‘you’ve reached the place
you want to be, let him be fed and leave him, and he’ll find
his way back here to me, if it’s here he’s a mind to be. Now
farewell, and Mary watch over you!’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha hugged the bony neck to her breast, burning from
the white poteen.</p>

<p>‘Go where I’m going, Porter!’ she breathed.
‘Go!’</p>

<p>Porter took a turn about the yard, tossing his head and
whinnying to his mares in the stable. Then he surged straight
for the hedge across the road, knowing the way without telling,
and he leapt into the field beyond: and they were off, and the
post-house already far behind.</p>

<p>Oh, but what a ride that was!</p>

<p>They were crossing fields, streams and fences as fast as
memory. In the county of bogs Porter was dashing and darting
beneath quarried cliffs of peat, fragrant with roots and all the
buried past. Mud and spray were drenching the women’s legs,
and they must be closing their eyes and averting their faces.</p>

<p>‘Oh, can you go no faster?’ whispered Agatha in his
ear.</p>

<p>Faster than the Moon they were moving, and the wind sweeping
back the mane of the each dubh, and the women’s hair streaming
back like banners black and reddish-bronze.</p>

<p>The horse’s flanks were shivering now. It was harder to be
holding on. And dimly in the distance, in the last light of the
Moon, a glimmering lit the edge of the world.</p>

<p>That was the ridge of Connor’s warning to them: beyond it
lay the county of mist, and in the middle of the mist they’d
be finding the lough, the crannog, and the abbey of the Lady.</p>

<p>And far far ahead, they spied a fluttering, of a starling on
the wing. And Agatha whispered:</p>

<p>‘Let you catch me that starling, and pass her before she
cross the ridge.’</p>

<p>Violence shuddered through the steed. The wind was snapping
the women’s dresses like sails, fraying and rending.</p>

<p>Mielusine was laughing, she was so scared, shutting her eyes.
Agatha’s eyes were narrow as a Russian girl’s. Grand was
Connor’s poteen, the way they would have been thrown into a
ditch long before then, but for the fire of it searing their
arms and their limbs and helping them hold on.</p>

<p>Now the starling was a quarter mile ahead, a stone’s cast
off the ridge. Porter was laboring up the long slope. And the
Moon slipped behind the dark rise to the left.</p>

<p>The foam boiled off the stallion’s neck, stinging and
burning Lady Agatha’s eyes. She rubbed them on her shoulder
and looked back in time to see the starling, bobbing in the air,
fall behind them as they shot past. And beyond the ridge
stretched a lake, bright as a mirror, as far as the eye could
see.</p>

<p>Over the ridge, across the road raced the each dubh, helpless
to stop: they fell into the water with a stinging great splash,
even as Agatha cried out her exultation.</p>

<p>But strangely, they plunged into the lake without being wet;
and it was not water, but mist, so thick its surface cast back
the moonlight like waves.</p>

<p>And all that darkness until moonrise they were descending the
inner slope, walking and leading the horse. They had to, the
mist was so thick in that county. Mielusine was lying moaning on
Porter, and he in a muck sweat, his sides bleeding, near dead
with the racing.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my poor darling, my Porter,’ moaned Mielusine,
‘will you be well again? Oh, I’m all sore and shaking,
Agatha, why did you bid him to go so fast?’</p>

<p>Lady Agatha led the way. She paid the Maid no mind. Only one
thought she was thinking, and that was this, how far a lead
Eudemarec had, and where was he now?</p>

<p>Heavier and heavier weighed Aengus in her mind.</p>

<p>The fury of the ride had been a respite, but the poteen was
burned out of her now. ‘So comes the prisoner home into his
jail,’ she was murmuring. ‘Not hopefully and not defiantly,
but merely because he must. Because in truth he never
left.’</p>

<p>It was not that she was wanting to see Aengus again. She was
dreading it. She was hoping he would have gone away, no man knew
where. She had no trust in herself, in what she would do when
she saw him. And she was hating herself for it.</p>

<p>Three times the Moon rose, and three times she fell; in the
county of mist the mist was brightening a bit when as the Moon
was rising, and the mist was darkening a bit when as the Moon
was hid. The women went on, now leading the horse, now riding
Porter, slowly now in that treacherous land.</p>

<p>Maid Mielusine never knew that in the darkness while she lay
resting, Lady Agatha would be rising, and twisting grass-stalks
in her fingers, and walking about in the black mist, that like a
thousand dewy mouths was tormenting her, gnawing at her face and
hair and hands.</p>

<p>Agatha would not eat, lest the comfort let her rest. She fled
from her dreams, that were still betraying her.</p>

<p>‘How long since I slept last, I wonder?’ she would ask
herself, and be counting and reckoning up the moons as a
distraction.</p>

<p>‘Agatha, is it time to be going again?’ murmured the Maid
sleepily from her blankets on the grass.</p>

<p>‘Hush now, and be sleeping again, my puss,’ said Agatha,
and passing her palm over the Maid’s brow; Mielusine’s eyes
lowered, and the easy peace of sleep returned over her face.
Then Agatha took up her pacing again, pacing up and down, to and
fro, back and forth, in a rut of seventeen paces, even as once
he had, long ago in the world of the Sun.</p>

<p class="break">DEEP IN THE COUNTY of mist they climbed across
a hillside, that was like a huge barrow or tomb-yard of ancient
kings and warriors from the Five Kingdoms. From the top of that
barrow they were looking down on a cluster of folk. The folk
were leaving, and Lady Agatha led the way down to where those
others had been. By the path was the Lady’s Well caught in a
circle of stones.</p>

<p>‘I know of this place,’ said Agatha, wondering. ‘But
it’s not here this place should be; or am I all turned about
again?’</p>

<p>It was the way of the Night-land, that no map was solid and
safe, but all the places shifted and slid about, and a body
never knew what place would appear on the road ahead.</p>

<p>‘What is the name of it?’ asked Mielusine.</p>

<p>‘And I drank of the water of this well,’ said Agatha.
‘I was that young and proud, and it wasn’t the country-boy
courting me I was wanting, but a man of some estate, wealthy and
of power.’</p>

<p>She lifted out some water from the well, holding it cupped in
her hands. ‘Drink it, now,’ she said to Mielusine. ‘Drink,
and think on Master Aengus.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’ll do that,’ answered the maid. And she lapped
the water out of the lady’s hands. But the each dubh would not
drink out of that well.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as Agatha dipped her hands in the water of the
well, it started to rise. It rose up to the lip of the circle of
stones holding it, and overflowed, and ran down in a little
stream between the slopes.</p>

<p>‘Come along,’ said Agatha. She took Maid Mielusine by the
hand, and they followed the stream.</p>

<p>Down they traveled, deeper in that mist, the land rising and
falling, and on the hillsides hundreds of fruit trees, wild
apple, quince and pear. The little stream was running between
the hills, snaking between the trees, and the women were
following it.</p>

<p>And the deeper into that vale they went, the deeper came a
sleepiness into Agatha, so that she could scarcely stay
awake.</p>

<p><i>How long since I slept last, I wonder?</i> she was asking
herself, but that answer did not come.</p>

<p>They passed one thousand tents and wagons, filled with
dangerous wild-looking folk; and the gleams in the eyes of those
men caused the Maid to shrink closer to Agatha for safety. Glad
she was, when they came out from the midst of that
encampment!</p>

<p>The Moon was falling. That was the Lughnasadh Moon, Lammas in
the old calendar of Day. And from ahead a rich smell of rotting
reached them, and the lapping of little waves.</p>

<p>‘Is it the lough? Can we stop now?’ asked Mielusine. She
was so tired she was almost falling.</p>

<p>But tired as the Maid was, the lady was worn by an even
deeper fatigue. She had drunk none of the water of the Lady’s
Well, and now an utter sleepiness was overtaking her.</p>

<p><i>How long since I slept last, I, I cannot</i> – ‘oh! I
cannot go on!’ sighed Agatha. She pulled the Maid forward,
almost falling on her.</p>

<p>‘Mielusine,’ she whispered into the Maid’s ear, ‘over
that rise now, the lough is surely lying. Listen! Do you not
hear that clanging of iron upon iron, like a bitter bell?
Mielusine, let you go on before me. Go on and call back to me,
tell me what you’re seeing!’</p>

<p>Mielusine, impelled by her friend, went after the stream up
between the apple trees. Soon she was vanished in the mist
beyond. The beating of the iron bell rolled across the unseen
water.</p>

<p>Agatha knelt down on the moss beside the little stream.
Sleepiness conquering her, and she scarce able to keep her eyes
open. Into the stream she murmured,</p>

<p>‘Mielusine, I cannot see! What is it you’re seeing?’</p>

<p>The Maid’s little voice came back along with the ripples,
answering. ‘Yes, it is the lough! I see dim yellow lights to
the left, of a small village. And out in the lough the mist is a
white cloud, and other lights are gleaming like witch-lights
over marshes.’</p>

<p>Agatha crept closer to the stream to hear better over the
rushing of her sleepiness, and whispered into the water,
‘Mielusine, I cannot see! What is it you’re seeing?’</p>

<p>Faintly the Maid’s voice sprang up out of the ripples. ‘I
see another light close to hand. Three torches burn at the
water’s edge. Two men are there in silver and scarlet coats,
and one ringing an iron bell upon a pole.’</p>

<p>Agatha let close her eyes. So sweet, so sweet some bit of
sleep would be! She wormed yet closer over the water, put her
lips down just over it and breathed, ‘Mielusine, I cannot see!
What is it you’re seeing?’</p>

<p>But no answer was coming from the stream. The Maid was
stricken silent.</p>

<p>For in the water of the lough was a swanlike barge, and on it
stood a woman. It was tall she was, masked, and enfolded in a
rich enormous cloak, that was black and chased with silver.</p>

<p>And on the mud where the stream ran laughing in the lough,
two men were walking. They took another step apart with every
peal of the bell. They held pistols in their hands, gleaming
white and cold. And they were in the midst of a pistol-duel,
those two.</p>

<p>One man was a stranger to the maid; the other was
Eudemarec.</p>

<p>‘Eudemarec! Eudemarec, it’s me, it’s Maid Mielusine!’
she called. But the Breton paid her no mind. He had thoughts
only on his duel, and the killing of his enemy.</p>

<p>In the misty torchlight Maid Mielusine could barely make the
stranger out. But there was something wrong with his leg, the
way he was limping.</p>

<p>Back in the mist, by the edge of the stream, Agatha’s head
was nodding; her eyes they were closing in sleep, and her breath
was heavy, deep, and slow. She was hearing her breathing, and
nothing else, and no voice reaching her from the duel by the
lough.</p>

<p>‘Eudemarec, let you be stopping,’ Mielusine cried.</p>

<p>From the lough the tall lady lifted her eyes and held the
Maid’s gaze. And in that stare Mielusine felt a great fear,
and found she could not speak, nor move, nor think.</p>

<p>And the lady spoke to her and told her, chill as mist,
‘Girl, be still: you will spoil the game.’</p>

<p>Then the bell rang, one last time; the shivers of iron ran
out and back across the waters of the lough; and the two men
turned to face each other, across a gulf of thirteen paces.</p>

<p>Agatha sighed, and fell into sleep; her head nodded down, and
her lips touched the water of the stream coming from the
Lady’s Well.</p>

<p>Eudemarec was standing very still, and the stranger was
raising his pistol. The stranger took aim and fired. That shot
boomed like cannon-fire across the quiet lough. But the
stranger’s aim was careless, and the recoil all but threw him
down, leaving the Breton unscathed.</p>

<p>And a drop of the water of the well wetted Agatha’s lips,
so she tasted it, and drank; then all at once the weariness was
leaving her, and she jerked back her head, and looked about her:
Where was she, and what was that crash she had heard, like
thunder?</p>

<p>Eudemarec smiled.</p>

<p>‘Now, Master Aengus, you devil, you monster, you
hell-spawn,’ he uttered, ‘I have you now.’</p>

<p>He leveled his pistol. Calmly he drew back the hammer with
his thumb, and tightened his finger over the trigger. The hammer
fell; the muzzle roared; white flame burst from it.</p>

<p>Agatha staggered to her feet, and looked about.</p>

<p>In that roar the stranger fell.</p>

<p><i>Aengus!</i> her heart was crying. <i>Aengus!</i></p>

<p>Eudemarec crossed the stream and strode over to the body.</p>

<p>The stranger moaned on the wet mud, and stirred a bit.</p>

<p>‘What,’ muttered the Breton, ‘still alive, after that?
You take a deal of killing, sir.’ He drew a second pistol from
his belt.</p>

<p>‘Hold,’ said the lady, raising her black-gloved hand.</p>

<p>Eudemarec brought the muzzle of the pistol down against the
stranger’s head. ‘No,’ muttered Eudemarec. ‘I’ll not
hold. Not if it cost me my life.’</p>

<p>‘It will cost you more than that.’</p>

<p>‘He robbed me of my love, and she was all I valued
more.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll find yourself another love. Besides, your job is
done. Your man is dead. Isn’t that right, girl?’</p>

<p>Agatha let her feet follow the stream, the way the sound of
those shots seemed to be coming from that way. The grass beneath
her feet turned wet and muddy, and she saw dim yellow lights to
the left, of a small village. And out in the lough the mist was
a white cloud, and other lights were gleaming like witch-lights
over marshes, even as the Maid had said.</p>

<p>Mielusine came down to the lakeside. She turned the heavy
woolen clad shoulders of the fallen man, and laid the head of
him into her lap. Brushing back his hair she was looking on him,
wondering, Was this truly Master Aengus?</p>

<p>The cheek of him was rough, and marks of torment were traced
about the closed eyes. His flesh was waxen, bloodless. The Maid
was stroking his closed, bent face, smoothing the lines, until a
sort of peacefulness was coming over it. Calm was he seeming,
calm and cold as death itself.</p>

<p>She felt the man’s throat. There was no movement there.</p>

<p>Hot tears stung her eyes. ‘It is true,’ she groaned.
‘He is dead now.’</p>

<p>Agatha heard faint voices by the water’s edge, and she
wandered on as though she still dreamed. It was against herself
her feet were fighting, as though they were knowing what she’d
find ahead, and wishing to spare her the sight and the knowing
of it. But she went on. She could see another light close to
hand. Three torches burned at the water’s edge. Two men were
standing there in silver and scarlet coats, and one holding the
pull-rope to an iron bell upon a pole.</p>

<p>Eudemarec looked down on the body of the unknown foreigner he
had sworn to murder. It was far away now that oath seemed to
him, buried behind ramparts of thorn in the Broceliande.</p>

<p>‘But if he is dead,’ he wondered, ‘why is it still
Night?’</p>

<p>‘It’s the wrong tales you’ve been heeding,’ answered
the lady ironically. ‘It was only that man there, could have
brought back the Sun. Now he’s dead, and the Sun will never
shine again. Mary bless you for it!’</p>

<p>Agatha stopped, staring at the two men by the bell. The
boatmen left the bell, heeding a gesture of the lady; they went
down the mud-flats by the ripples of the lough and gathered up
the body of the dead man. And they bore the body up the slope
away from the water. In the grass at the edge of the orchards
they buried it. Their spades crunched into the pebbly earth; and
when the men beat down the filled-in soil, the sounds resounded
over the glimmering lough like the strokes of hammers.</p>

<p>Every blow of those spades upon the Earth beat heavy on the
heart of Agatha, as though it was herself they had buried, and
were sealing away from life in the Earth.</p>

<p>The lady stood at the head of the little grave. She crushed
and sprinkled a few leaves over the black mound. A smell of
peppermint filled the air. The lady stooped and whispered to the
Earth, while the Maid wept and sniveled.</p>

<p>Agatha from a distance was looking on, amazed. <i>It isn’t
truth</i>, she was thinking. <i>This is some foul theater-piece,
it cannot be real.</i></p>

<p>The lady stood, and looked to the Breton. He was staring at
the grave.</p>

<p>What thoughts and dreams scattered themselves through the
brain of him, seeing it done, and the end of his long quest?</p>

<p>For many moons Eudemarec had searched for the man, the
legendary Aengus who had unbound the girdle of light. Now he’d
accomplished his oath. And now, because of that, the Sun would
never be rising again. And now, because of that, Mablaith would
sleep until the end of the world. It was Mablaith Eudemarec had
killed this hour.</p>

<p>‘You fought with style,’ said the lady, passing to the
water’s edge. ‘You will come with us into the abbey.’</p>

<p>‘I want to go also,’ said Mielusine.</p>

<p>Agatha made her feet move forward. She came near to the
grave.</p>

<p>‘Let you come then,’ allowed the lady. ‘You are
delicate as the heather of this land. It’s one of my wards
you’ll be, and a dancer in the casino.’</p>

<p>‘And Agatha,’ added Mielusine.</p>

<p>Agatha knelt at the side of the grave. She gripped the dirt
in her fingers. Now tears were welling in her eyes, but she
spoke no word. Only a little mewing came out, like a cat’s.</p>

<p>‘Not her,’ said the lady. ‘She’s the last of all
I’ll be letting in. Well, girl? Are you coming?’</p>

<p>‘Agatha,’ Mielusine said softly. She got no answer. She
looked to the barge, to the lady waiting there. She was so
glamorous that Mielusine went to join her.</p>

<p>With an unhasty pace the boatmen poled the Swan barge out
upon the lough, toward the white buildings of the abbey emerging
from the silver mist.</p>

<p class="break">DRINKING AT THE WATER’S EDGE, Porter was
watching them go. When the ferry at length was dissolving in the
mist the horse tossed his head. He nudged the huddled woman by
the grave, but got only a mew for answer.</p>

<p>The each dubh trotted up the path, and a dark man stepped out
in his way, took hold of his reins, and leapt upon his back.</p>

<p>The man straightened his dark gray cóta mór, and bent over
Porter’s neck, and whispered these words into his ears:</p>

<p>‘Go where I’m going, Porter! Go!’</p>

<p>In the glow of the Moon rising beyond the mist, the Each Dubh
gathered speed, and bore the dark man away over the hills beyond
the wild orchards.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15"></a> 15. How She Lingered by the Lough</h2>

<p class="first">ROUND THE LOUGH away from the tents where the
bandits dwelt, those that would be going over to the abbey,
there stood an old village, left over from the day; and the
villagers came out of their doors only when the Moon was
gleaming through the mist, and the lights of the crannog were
snuffed.</p>

<p>The crannog in the lough had been there since before St.
Patrick. With hundreds of timbers and thousands of stones as big
as men’s heads, ancient hands had built up the island in the
lough. There the abbey had stood safe from the raiders, the
chieftains, the warriors and the Northmen. For hundreds of years
since then it had gone abandoned, left for boys to go fishing
from in day, for birds to be nesting on in night.</p>

<p>In the last day the fires had rained in a great ring around
that county, until sheets of mist and darkness swallowed them
all.</p>

<p>It was only afterward that the villagers first glimpsed
witchlights out on the lough. The villagers learned the abbey
was rebuilding on the crannog. And they found that if their cows
ate of the sedge over the lough in the Night, no butter would be
coming from their cream. After that it was out of nearby streams
the villagers were drawing their water, and never the lough
itself.</p>

<p>In the village they were telling how the lough was tainted,
and lured folk into sinning. They all came to that place, all
wives whose husbands were Sleeping, and all husbands whose wives
were Sleeping. They brought the money of their spouses to the
abbey, and spent it on their lovers.</p>

<p>In the village they were telling of wayward children playing
too near the lough in the white moons of summer. How they fell
drowsy in the sedge, covered with mist while lights danced on
the water. And how, come moonrise, anxious mothers found them
curled up at the water’s edge, seeming asleep, smiling
sweetly. But they were dead.</p>

<p>Some in the village were telling how those children were not
dead at all, but stolen away to serve in the abbey, where they
never got older. It was only models of clay left at the
water’s edge, so true to life they were fooling even the
little ones’ own mothers.</p>

<p>And they were telling how, if a girl’s love could not be,
for the anger of her father or the enmity of kin, then she would
go to the abbey and drown her heartsickness in laughter and
lust; else she would go in darkness to the water, and clothed
round with wildflowers she would surrender herself to the lough
bubbling up around her. And she would be lying on the dark bed
of the lough, among the deep reeds dead.</p>

<p>You might even be catching such a one if you flung a net into
the deep. But it was ill-luck and accurst to wake her, if you
were not meant to charm her sore heart and be her lover. So none
of the village lads tried, though some of the abbey-folk, as it
was said, had done.</p>

<p>In the bright of the Lammas Moon the villagers ventured out,
and found the woman by the grave. She was rocking on her
haunches, back and forth, mewing. Not a word would she speak to
any of their questions or remarks. In the end they took her in
and tended to her. They were thinking she had lost her
reason.</p>

<p>She was drinking the broth they were giving her, and eying
them suspiciously. One of the men stood over her, and looked her
in the eye.</p>

<p>‘Did you run into folk from the abbey, child?’ he asked.
‘Is that what happened? What were they doing now, that it left
yourself in such a state?’</p>

<p>‘Mary bless you,’ said an elder woman of them, ‘I’ll
tell you. ’Twas the tall hero, came first to the water. He
shouts his challenge across the lough, and it echoing back
answerless. Only at moonfall, the ferry comes gliding out, and
the two men fight for the sake of the beautiful young miss, and
the lady of the lough presiding over it all. It’s back to the
crannog they went.’</p>

<p>The woman opened her mouth and said, ‘The crannog?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but you mustn’t think of going there, shivering and
half naked as you are. ’Twould be the death of you.’</p>

<p>The stranger woman pushed the older one back and went out
into the lane. Children were playing there, and the eyes of men
and women upon her.</p>

<p>‘She has the mark on her now, and it’s the greatest
shame,’ whispered one.</p>

<p>‘I warrant she was fair, one time,’ answered another.</p>

<p>‘Fair, aye: a magistrate’s darling, forsaken when the day
died.’</p>

<p>She turned on them.</p>

<p>‘How will I be crossing to the crannog?’</p>

<p>They stared at her. None of them were answering her at
first.</p>

<p>‘Moy-rua, none of us will row you there,’ said a man at
last. ‘The ferry’s the only way. And it only goes after
moonfall; and they’re choosy who they take.’</p>

<p>That was all the answer she got.</p>

<p class="break">MUDDY SEDGE skirted the lough away from the
village. The stranger woman scooped up water and drank from her
black-marked palm. It was warm, that water, running in her belly
with secret life.</p>

<p>All that moon, she stayed by Aengus’ grave.</p>

<p>All her bitterness was burnt out of her now. He was punished
and dead, the way she would never be seeing him again. But the
memory of him was yet alive. She missed him.</p>

<p>All that moon, there was one small break in the cloud of
mist. A ray of moonlight was falling onto Master Aengus’ grave
and the woman kneeling there keening her grief.</p>

<p>The keening went on long after the moonlight failed. But at
last the woman’s voice broke, and she slumped on the dirt.</p>

<p class="break">LATE IN THE DARK of the moon, one of those Swan
boats was poled over to land from the crannog. From the boat
stepped the lady in the silver cloak. She ignored the grave and
the sleeping woman, and walked about the lanes of the village.
Her quick, light step passed among the cottages where the
grownups of the villagers were lying abed dreaming. As she went,
the lady hummed to herself a sprightly tune.</p>

<p>The children of the villagers, now, hearing the humming, rose
and went to her. They crowded round her in their nightshirts,
clamoring softly, ‘Take me with you! Take me! Take me!’</p>

<p>The lady smiled on them, and handed them all little sweets
and candies and drops wrapped in silver-paper. And she sent them
back into their homes, and they were chewing and sucking on the
sweets for the rest of the darkness, until they fell into their
beds dreaming. Aand ever thereafter those children stayed up
when the Moon went down, and dreamed when the moonlight flooded
their little rooms, and talked back to their parents; and it was
a trouble to their parents to be rousing them when the Moon
rose.</p>

<p>The lady passed back into the ferry, and let herself be taken
back into the crannog. But from up in the land hoofbeats echoed
across the waters, and the great each dubh Porter showed himself
on the crest of the hill thorned with the wild low trees. A man
in a dark gray cóta mór stepped off the steed, gave him
sweets, and sent him back to his master. Meantime the dark man
stood on the top of the hill looking down over the lough. He dug
his hands into the deep pockets of his coat, and pulled out a
bag full of hand-small stones. Those he scattered in a circle in
the grass about him, and sat down on his haunches.</p>

<p>Silently the dark man buried himself in his cóta mór gazing
down over the mist on the water, waiting.</p>

<p>Lights were burning on the lough that darkness, but no more
Swan boats crossed. Only, just before moonrise, one was softly
poled to shore. The two ferrymen, muffled in great cloaks,
climbed the slope. One bore a lantern, its iron panels shut so
that only a thin beam licked the ground.</p>

<p>They put the lantern down by the grave, and set to digging
furtively. They took care not to waken the woman curled at their
feet.</p>

<p>On the top of the slope the man in the dark gray cloak
watched them, and he touched the peak of his tricorn hat to the
grave of Master Aengus; but it seemed the ferrymen didn’t
notice the man, hidden as he was behind the circle of his
stones. They ended their work, and took back to the abbey that
thing they had been sent to fetch. It was only just in time they
were: the Moon was already burning at the edges of the mist,
when their poles sent back their ripples to the shore.</p>

<p>The rising Moon woke the mourner, and she went down to drink
once more. She sat by the grave in the patch of moonlight. She
did not guess what they had done, while she had lain sleeping;
she did not guess what things befell in the abbey on the crannog
across the water, deep in the whiteness of the mist.</p>

<p class="break">WHEN DARKNESS came again, the ferrymen poled
the Swan boat across and back again, as their business bade
them. From the encampment people were coming, leaving their
tents and wagons and carriages, and themselves going over to the
abbey.</p>

<p>They were an odd blend. Some gentle men and gentle ladies,
others marked like tinkers; wenches and rogues, minxes and
bandits, jades and rascals; farmers and fishermen; these
rushing, and those laughing wickedly; the others fingering the
hilts of their scians or the pommels of their pistols.</p>

<p>And some were stopped along the way by a sad-eyed creature in
rags, calling to them from the sedge,</p>

<p>‘Take me across with you, Sir!’</p>

<p>But they were shaking their heads. ‘It’s no place for
you, girl. Go back to your village and marry. It’s still being
done, you know, for all that it is Night.’</p>

<p>And the creature went to the mooring-pole, asking the boatmen
to carry her across.</p>

<p>‘What will you be paying?’ they asked.</p>

<p>‘I will pay you after,’ answered the creature.</p>

<p>‘If you lack courage, you cannot cross.’</p>

<p>‘I am Lady Agatha. Is that courage enough for you?’</p>

<p>The ferrymen looked each other in the eye. ‘You are the
Lady Agatha? It was for you the Irishman sank the sun? Then you
will never cross, the way you are the lady’s enemy.’</p>

<p>And once more the stars wheeled round to touch the Samhain
mark, when all souls and dreams are loosed. And for four and
twenty hours the Moon did not rise nor shine.</p>

<p>When the Moon returned, and the lights across the lough faded
again, and the creature was left behind. From over the rise the
village waked again, and some of the village women were pitying
the creature sitting in the sedge, and leaving her baskets of
food.</p>

<p>Now some hours passed, and the Moon was after falling, and a
group of girls came sneaking out of the village, nervous as
geese, passing the creature on the way to the mooring-pole.</p>

<p>‘Where are you bound?’ she asked them.</p>

<p>‘Surely we’re for the abbey,’ they answered her, ‘to
enter the lady’s service.’</p>

<p>‘What will you be doing there?’</p>

<p>‘Clean and cook, and serve and sew and all. And we’ll be
learning to be like them, and after nine Moons they will be
giving us each for a duais a brand-new chest, and bright pretty
gowns, plates and cups, and all we need to be winning our
loves.’</p>

<p>‘Let me be going with you.’</p>

<p>‘But she only sent for seven! If you go, one of us must
stay behind.’</p>

<p>Then in her need the creature drew out the last of her
belongings. Gold its chain, the emerald bright as her eyes had
been in day.</p>

<p>‘Now what one of you will be taking this for her dress, and
the right to go across with you?’</p>

<p>The girls were eying one another, but hung back.</p>

<p>‘Please,’ she breathed, ‘it’s all I have, and I must
cross.’</p>

<p>‘Lady, you may have my place,’ said one. ‘I will cross
another time. But keep your jewel, the way I wouldn’t know
what to do with it.’</p>

<p>‘Hold it for surety then, or sell it for a house full of
plate and linen, the way it is worth ten times that.’</p>

<p>Still the girl wavered, shaking her head. But it fell out
that an old woman from the village was passing, and she scolded
the girl something terrible for being so foolish, and talked her
over to taking the jewel.</p>

<p>Then in the lake water the girls washed the mud from the poor
sad creature, and were drying her with their aprons and hiding
her from prying eyes while she drew on the homespun dress, even
while the boatmen came, and tied up the Swan boat on the
mooring-poles.</p>

<p>The girls went in a flock to the mooring-pole and into the
boat. The stranger woman was shivering with damp and fever, bent
low in the middle of the girls lest the boatmen notice her.</p>

<p>The boatmen hardly looked upon one out of yet another group
of girls lured by the glamour of the witchlights into running
away from their homes and risking themselves in the abbey. Where
some would be finding their fortune, and others their ruin, but
all alike in this, that they would never be able to go back into
their village and take up the life they had known before.</p>

<p>And the lantern at the ferry’s prow was burning in their
eyes, and the lantern at the mooring-pole fading away, and with
it the shore, the village, and the land. In darkness they were
gliding across the whispering water, and in their ears were
growing the sounds of revelry, the closer they were to the
crannog in the lough, and the white walls of the abbey emerging
from the mist.</p>

<h1><a name="part3"></a> Part III. <br>
The Full Moon</h1>

<h3>The Fifth Year of Night</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the fifth year of that Night, some
Special Ones became known. And they walked apart from all their
brother Waking.</i></p>

<p><i>And the others, who were the most part of the Waking,
sought the Special Ones to be their teachers.</i></p>

<p><i>And some apprentices learned well at the hand of the
Special Ones.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch16"></a> 16. Of the Leag Lorgmhar</h2>

<p class="first">GENTLY, the Swan Boat bumped upon the
crannog.</p>

<p>The ferrymen slung the ropes about the mooring poles, and the
seven girls walked up the planks and onto the ground of the
crannog. The mist seemed thicker here, and the girls were
feeling its chill droplets kissing their cheeks; on the girls’
hair the droplets caught the light like brilliants. Hanging in
the mist, moving about, globes of brightness slowly swam over
head. Some of the globes were no larger than a man’s head,
others a full fathom wide. The globes trailed spiny black tails
that were propelling them through the air.</p>

<p>At the end of the mooring a woman was waiting, and she was
Old Meg. Old Meg looked the girls over with her bright, bright
eyes while they were curtsying to her; then she swept her arm
back behind of herself.</p>

<p>‘Welcome,’ said Meg.</p>

<p>The girls looked about, eating up the wonderful sights of the
place. In the moonlight the abbey and the crannog could never be
seen from the village, the mist was so blinding white. But in
the dark of the moon could be seen, not so much the thing
itself, but only the image of its lights in the water. Through
the dark of the moon the abbey was ablaze, and the village dark
and closed. Only, here and there, a shutter softly opened, and a
young lad or pale-eyed lass would be gazing out into the mist,
and wondering. They never beheld the true shape of the abbey,
they who dared not cross and enter service there, as these girls
did.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Meg, the mistress of the girls, looking them
over; ‘this crop seems a bit better than the usual run of what
straggles over; all but you, the last one there: why, you’re
hardly a girl at all, and have a proud look in your eyes.’</p>

<p>The creature stared back at Meg. Meg sighed, threw up her
hands and said, ‘Well, what ever can the lady expect of me,
when I’m getting such as this! Come along then, girls, don’t
be gawking, it’s impolite, and likely to win you a whipping
hereabouts. Mark me, come along now!’</p>

<p>Meg took the girls round the buildings to their beds, the
better to be showing them the place, and telling them their
duties. Quietly they trooped round beneath the high, white stone
walls. Through the airs around them swam the witchlights,
globular, effulgent fish, trailing snaky tails, breathing out
brightness from their gills.</p>

<p>The abbey was not so much built by the setting of stone upon
stone, as spun like a spider’s bridge. Its halls and rooms
were never the same, but changeable as the body of a woman.
Sometimes this building was the refectory, sometimes it was the
brewery; the lady chapel there, now: next darkness, maybe the
garden would be in its place. It could be a maze at times, and
you never knowing what would be the room beyond the door you
were opening. But there was a place for the servants, and a
place for the kitchens, and a place for a bell-tower rising over
the shell of a basilica, and a place for Arianna’s
blood-hounds; that much at least could be said.</p>

<p>And the grandest building there was the casino. Once of a
time it had served as the Abbot’s home and offices; now the
Italian pleasure-house, it rose seven stories to the lady’s
chamber at the top of its forward tower, called the Lady’s
Tower; under which were the bedchambers of the gentle folk, the
lady’s wards and robbers, and down below them gaming rooms and
showing halls, and a feast hall. At its rearward wall rose the
framework for another tower, on which a few men were working;
that was called the Bride’s Tower, but its oldest stones were
centuries old, and no one would speak of the tale that lay
behind it. From the front doors of the casino to the lady’s
rooms above, seven stories up, coiled an immense marble
staircase, one hundred steps and a step all blackened with muck;
but all the other rooms of the casino were properly clean.</p>

<p>‘This will be your duty,’ Meg told the proud, proud girl;
‘what is it we’re to be calling you again?’</p>

<p>‘Agnes,’ the girl replied, flashing her eyes.</p>

<p>‘Agnes, well now, Agnes, then: you needn’t be helping any
of the others in their tasks, Agnes, no, you’re much too fine
and good for that, old Meg can tell your quality, Agnes, but all
you need be doing is the cleaning of the Hundred Steps and a
Step. And you needn’t even be working the whole nine months
out, but as soon as all the steps are white as a child’s
teeth, it’s free you’ll be. But if you fail, you go
empty-handed.’</p>

<p>And Meg laughed when she said it.</p>

<p class="break">THE SERVING-GIRLS slept in a dark, low hall,
half-buried in the crannog, and ever wet with lake-water seeping
up under their beds. Three times fifty cots there were, for
three times fifty girls.</p>

<p>And some were sobbing for homesickness, and some sighing for
love, and some deep in dream, their labors had been so hard.
Many were naked in the arms of their lovers in the upper
chambers, or filling their mouths with wine and sweet-meats in
the casino. They were the girls had been there longest, and
would not go back home.</p>

<p>Again and again the swan-boats poled across the lough,
discharging and collecting the wild folk of the abbey, the
robbers, the gamblers, the rogues and the jades. No one saw the
dark man in the cota mor squatting on the hill. Until he rose,
as though after making up his mind, and stepped out of the
circle of his stones. Gently he strode down to the water’s
edge, holding his tricorn low and his muffler high over his
face, and he joined the others waiting, and was ferried across
with no questions into the white buildings grown up on the
crannog.</p>

<p class="break">MAID MIELUSINE had been welcomed to the abbey,
the way she was the lady’s ward. She was given chambers high
in the casino, and told to prepare herself, the way in time she
must be welcomed by the waters. But Mielusine kept to her
chambers, and did not dress, and did not go down the Hundred
Steps and a Step in the processions.</p>

<p>So she stayed there, lonely and longing, looking out the
window into the bright mist. Witchlights swam in and out of the
window, glowing in her chambers, some of them pink, others
greenly glowing, or golden or amber or gray. It was the virtue
of those fish to be dark and drinking in the light while the
Moon was rising, and breathing back light when she sank. Some of
the serving girls, those who had been there longest, brought her
up food and the oddments she was needing; it was themselves told
her of the abbey.</p>

<p>‘In the abbey,’ said one, ‘all is intrigue and passion.
Here is no mourning for the Day. In the abbey Arianna built her
playground, and stocked it well with meat and drink, amusements,
women, and men.’</p>

<p>‘Arianna!’ exclaimed Mielusine. ‘Who is she now, and
where did she come from? I was never hearing of her in the
day.’</p>

<p>‘Och!’ cried one girl. ‘The Lady Arianna was fished up
out of the bed of the lough, after a sleep longer than
centuries, by a horseman who had come.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, why are you filling her head with such nonsense?’
cried another. ‘The truth of it is, Miss, that in the day
Arianna was no better than a common adventuress.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and she killed the King’s chief magistrate in a
castle in Wales.’</p>

<p>‘No, that’s not it at all! Miss, listen to me, I’ll be
telling you the truth. I heard it from a certain gentleman, and
he in a position to know, that Arianna is a foreigner out of the
East.’</p>

<p>‘No, not the East: it’s Italy she hails from, now:
Venice, I heard said. She was a noblewoman there, shut up in a
convent by her family for the hotness of her blood–’</p>

<p>‘Hold your tongue now, don’t be filling her head with
lies!’ shouted another, giggling: ‘Truth is, Arianna was a
courtesan, who tempted men from the shade of the Coliseum in
Rome.’</p>

<p>‘No, you’re wrong,’ said the first, and ‘You’re the
lying one!’ said another. Every serving girl was telling
Mielusine a different tale; and there were too many tales of
Arianna.</p>

<p>So Mielusine kept for many darknesses undressed in her
chambers, and was frightened to be going down in the
processions, the way even the serving girls there were splendid.
She was standing naked in her shift in the high open windows of
her bedchamber. She was looking out into the burning silver
mist, feeling its droplets on her throat and her breast, tasting
its watery perfume, breathing it in. And the mist off the lough
was rousing desires in Maid Mielusine for longing, for daring,
for recklessness, and for more.</p>

<p>In her loneliness she was thinking more and more on Master
Aengus. She could not get beyond it, that he was dead. Lady
Agatha had taught Mielusine dances and all manner of things,
with only Master Aengus in mind; now he was no more, what was
the good of her?</p>

<p>His rooms, high in the bell-tower, were still empty. No one
was admitted there.</p>

<p>One moonrise, when the lady and the court lay down to dream,
Mielusine dressed herself, uncomfortable in the heavy dress
after going so long in only her shift. She touched open the door
to her bedchamber, and crept down out onto the crannog. The
moonglow was burning her cheek like the blush of a secret sin.
She walked across the lawns between the high buildings into the
blasted, black shadow of the basilica. She stepped into the ruin
and softly climbed the bell-tower stairs to Master Aengus’
door.</p>

<p>And she turned the latch in the door, and stepped into the
darkness beyond.</p>

<p class="break">A GREAT WAYS DOWN below her, in the
pleasure-house, Agnes was nearing the Hundred Steps and a Step.
It was her first time at her chore. In the abbey, the servants
toiled while the gentle ladies dreamed.</p>

<p>She looked up those steps, at the dirt on them, at the black
on them.</p>

<p>She had a pail of soapy water, a scrub brush and a rag. She
was dipping the brush into the water and scrubbing the step; and
after a bit she was wiping the step off with the rag, rinsing
the rag in the water; and when the water was black, but the step
no less so, she was bearing the pail out, emptying it, filling
it, and staggering back.</p>

<p>At last, come moonfall, the first step seemed a little less
black and a little more gray. She sighed, wiped her brow and
thought to herself, <i>That’s better, now! And next time
better still!</i></p>

<p>But when she came back the next moonrise, the step was even
blacker than the others. The way she was starting over again,
moon after moon, and every blessed moon.</p>

<p>In the dark of the moon she was not resting, but went out
looking on the windows of the pleasure-house. She heard the
music, the laughter, and the indolent voices of the nobles of
the Night. She was hating them all for their ease and pleasures.
And she was looking up higher, to the windows fading into mist,
and wondering which was Arianna’s.</p>

<p>The serving-girls took their meals in a low hall alongside
the kitchens. Agnes ate on a rock over the water, looking into
the lough, until it was time to be back at her chore.</p>

<p>The steps she had cleaned were foul again, as always. There
was no end to it, it seemed. Standing before them one time more,
her pail in one hand and her brush in the other, her shoulders
shaking and tears starting from her eyes, she moaned, ‘But how
can this be? Who is doing this?’</p>

<p>‘I will show you, Miss,’ said a voice behind her – and
that was a voice she knew.</p>

<p class="break">MAID MIELUSINE stood a long time in Master
Aengus’ room. It was quiet in the cold bare bell-tower, and
black dark. All she could make out was a little glimmering of
the mist beyond the bells; by its light she could see nests
built up in the crannies, of rooks and owls, evil birds. In
front of herself stood a small table, and on it a packet and a
white stone smooth and rounded as a hen’s egg. Mielusine
touched the stone, and all of a sudden she heard an ominous
cough.</p>

<p>She stood stone still.</p>

<p>A slight rustling she heard. Someone else was there. A
servant of the lady, perhaps – or a thief with his hand on his
sharp scian dagger.</p>

<p>Mielusine turned and fled those dark rooms, fled down the
ladders and stairs, out to the lawn and into the gaming rooms.
It was the brightness and warmth and human voices lured her
there, the way the gamblers heeded no clock.</p>

<p>For a time Mielusine was wandering among the tables, looking
on the games and understanding none of them. At that hour only
the most ardent gamblers were there, and the rooms were quiet
but for the murmuring of wagers and the clinking of coins. Some
there went masked, some wore wigs, some still wore their
coats.</p>

<p>Mielusine stopped beside the table of the Wheel. She liked
seeing it spinning and the silver ball bounding into its
compartment all by chance. They were laying down their wagers on
a field of black and red squares. It was a mystery to Mielusine
how some were winning, and others watching fortunes raked away
and lost.</p>

<p>She was feeling something hard in her hand. Opening her
fingers she saw the leag lorgmhar.</p>

<p>She had never picked it up. Of course she hadn’t. But it
must be that she had taken it unthinkingly, startled by the
cough. And now she ought to be returning it, but she daren’t
go back into the bell-tower. </p>

<p>The players were laying their wagers on the field. Hastily
Mielusine placed the stone on the square of the Red.</p>

<p>‘What’s this, now? What sort of a wager is that?’</p>

<p>It was one of the lady players speaking. She was masked, but
the maid could see that her hair was brown, lighter than
chestnut, and that she had the longest, loveliest throat. The
servant at the table stopped the wheel, and all eyes turned to
Mielusine and the white stone.</p>

<p>‘Take the thing back, I say,’ demanded the lady, glaring
at Mielusine through her mask.</p>

<p>‘The lady can wager what she pleases, can she not?’</p>

<p>‘But ’tis a common stone, of no value at all!’</p>

<p>Mielusine would have taken back the thing; but the crowd was
gathering, hemming her in.</p>

<p>Next one was calling for Banker Ino. It was a dwarf he was,
with a great head on his body, and his face laughing, wise and
sour at once. Someone hoisted him onto the table where he stood
over them all like a little god.</p>

<p>‘Now, then,’ he pronounced, rocking back and forth,
‘what’s the problem here?’</p>

<p>‘It’s only the lady here placed a wager, Banker
Ino.’</p>

<p>‘It was a common stone she put down! There you see it, on
the Red. Make her take it back.’</p>

<p>‘She can wager what she likes,’ said another.</p>

<p>‘But,’ asked the servant, ‘what should I be giving her
if she wins?’</p>

<p>The dwarf looked from the stone to Mielusine in her white
dress, and she blushing and wishing she could only sink into a
puddle and die, and be done with it all.</p>

<p>‘Well, now,’ said the dwarf, very slowly in his child’s
voice, ‘I wouldn’t be calling it a thing of no value at all,
the way the lady herself is standing pledge behind her wager.
’Tis a white wager she’s playing, to be redeemed at the
winner’s own choosing. Who’s to say that’s of no
value?’</p>

<p>‘Not I to be sure.’</p>

<p>The last was uttered by a gentleman in a most grotesque and
sneering mask. He was tall as the Banker was short, and his hair
curling silver at his brow, and his voice as silver as his
curls. His eyes were so gentle and kind, Mielusine was thinking
she had never before seen such feeling eyes.</p>

<p>‘I will be backing the lady’s wager, if she will
permit,’ he was saying. He took up the stone and let fall a
thick handful of bank-notes in its place.</p>

<p>Even the dwarf was taken aback at the gesture, clucking,
‘But, sir, the amount—’</p>

<p>‘You’re right, of course,’ the man apologized. He
dredged in his pocket and strewed another handful of notes on
the pile, the way it was spilling over half the field. The
players looked agape on what a fortune it was, even in the
extravagant Night.</p>

<p>Ino laughed and clapped his hands. ‘Bravo! If the Maid Buan
has no further complaints?’ he added, bobbing in the
objector’s direction.</p>

<p>She, with a pretty if irritated wave of her golden fan,
inclined her head. ‘Sure, if the gentleman is bent upon
charity to the point of his ruin.’</p>

<p>‘Let spin, then,’ bade Ino. And the chamber the silver
ball fell into was the thirty-and-sixth, and it was red.</p>

<p>‘Will you take your winnings now?’ asked the gentleman in
the sneering mask at Mielusine’s side.</p>

<p>‘Oh – I couldn’t,’ Mielusine said.</p>

<p>‘The wager stands, then,’ he said. Of course that
hadn’t been Mielusine’s meaning at all. But the cheers made
her feel as bold as if it had been.</p>

<p>That spinning the ball fell in the sixteenth chamber, and it
too was red.</p>

<p>‘Again?’ asked the gentleman softly.</p>

<p>Mielusine felt a warm wave rising in her at the sound of his
voice. There was more money on the table than she in all her
life had ever dreamt of. ‘All right,’ she breathed.</p>

<p>And the number was two, and red.</p>

<p>‘Once more, for our mutual good fortune?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, let that be an end to it, please!’ begged Mielusine.
She only wanted to leave the crowd behind and be back in her
chamber again.</p>

<p>‘As madam commands,’ said the dwarf, bowing gravely.
‘You’ve taken half my profits of the month! As to the
gentleman, his part will find its way back to me. But will you
not take pity on me, dear Miss, and allow me to reinvest your
winnings in my bank? I assure you a good per centage.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I?’ Mielusine wondered.</p>

<p>‘Take at least so much for extravagance,’ said the
gentleman, brusquely putting a fistful of notes into her
hand.</p>

<p>‘How can I ever be thanking you?’ she asked. ‘You
risked so much for me!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, as to that, I had good fortune now, until you broke
it. If I’d lost my winnings, my creditors had had to go a bit
longer before drinking my blood. Now I must be leaving, the way
they will soon hear of this. I must be spending the moneys
before they do. And when next you are in difficulty, dear Lady
of the Stone, let you call upon Vasquez, and then you can be
thanking me by enjoying a little less of luck!’</p>

<p>With which he was gone, and the throng scattering, and Maid
Mielusine standing by the dwarf, before a great pile of money on
the table. They all were looking at her with such eyes, and she
made up her mind to be no longer afraid, but to be descend with
the other wards in the procession every darkness.</p>

<p>And she saw that after all she still was holding the Leag
Lorgmhar.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17"></a> 17. Of the Lady of the Lough</h2>

<p class="first">‘BUT HOW can this be? Who is doing this?’
Agnes moaned.</p>

<p>‘I can tell you, Miss,’ said a voice.</p>

<p>Agnes turned. A bit of a smile hung on her lips.</p>

<p>The man that was standing there was lean and tall and old,
and he was no stranger to her, the way he was Mac Bride, the old
servant of the manor.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mac Bridey. Of course you are here.’</p>

<p>The old cottager bowed, and gave her back a grin. ‘Will
your ladyship come with me now, and let an old countryman
enlighten a lady?’</p>

<p>‘Please, do not be calling me “lady” here, Mac Bride,
I’ve no heart left for such ironies.’</p>

<p>He led her across to a little room in a wall. Old tools and
broken buckets were covered in dust in the corners. ‘Here you
must abide me when your work is done, at moonfall. I will bring
you your dinner and show you a thing.’</p>

<p>At the end of her working, she put away rags and buckets and
brushes, and met Mac Bride at the closet. Soon they were
settling in the dark, and only some light entering through a
crack in the door panel, where Agnes put her eye.</p>

<p>She saw men in scarlet and silver climbing through the
witchlights swimming up the stairs.</p>

<p>‘Soon they will be coming,’ Mac Bride said.</p>

<p>‘Who?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Look, and see for yourself.’</p>

<p>From the landing high above, a strange procession was
descending. Foremost came the lady’s servants dressed like
maids and pages of years long gone. After them came the hundred
robbers of the lough, the jades and rogues, minxes and bandits,
each belted with sword or pistols; and the wenches wore each a
scian at her belt. They wore cloaks of scarlet embroidered with
the letter A in black, or cloaks of black with the letter A in
scarlet; and on the heels of their boots silver spurs, the like
of which she had seen before.</p>

<p>‘And out of all these desperadoes,’ said Mac Bride,
‘she will choose one to be her champion, for a darkness, a
Moon, or a year, as she please. She has a crescent silver ring.
When she chooses a champion she places this ring on his little
finger, pressing the finger back. But when she tires of him,
then the lady takes back the ring while he is sleeping, and –
and the rest I will not tell you.’</p>

<p>After the robbers came a most splendid lady. Her hair was
firelike in the glow of the enchanted fish; her eyes were green,
and she wore a crimson purple gown. She was tall and slender,
and so regal in her bearing that Agnes had to exclaim, ‘Is it
Arianna, now?’</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ answered Mac Bride, taking for a moment her place
at the crack. ‘But it is only Maid Niam, one of her
wards.’</p>

<p>Agnes looked again. ‘You are right,’ she said. ‘For her
bearing is not proud enough. But this one, now: she is the lady
for a truth!’</p>

<p>‘Tell me her features, the way I’m sure you’re wrong
again.’</p>

<p>‘Her hair is brown, lighter than chestnut, gleaming as with
diamonds. She has the longest, loveliest throat I’ve ever
seen. She carries a fan of gold, and her gown is dark and rich
as the finest chocolate from the new world.’</p>

<p>‘Ah: that is Maid Buan, another of her wards; she’s proud
enough for two.’</p>

<p>‘Now there is a man dressed like an admiral. He is tall and
beautiful, and well he knows it, too! He walks with the swagger
of a lion.’</p>

<p>‘That is Gwangior, the lady’s champion,’ Mac Bride
said. ‘And after him you will see another of her wards, and
she the newest and fairest: it’s said you know her.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Agnes quietly.</p>

<p>It was Maid Mielusine in her white gown; and though she may
have walked less boldly than the others, she surpassed them in
the delicacy of her movements, the fineness of her features, and
the openness of her eyes.</p>

<p>Seeing the Maid, Agnes felt all at once her own ugliness, and
how far she had fallen. When she could look again, the landing
above the stair was empty – save for one.</p>

<p>‘Arianna.’</p>

<p>She breathed the word, the way she could not speak above a
whisper.</p>

<p>Mac Bride nodded.</p>

<p>‘Now you have seen her. Tell me the way of her, then.’</p>

<p>Agnes parted her lips, and after a moment closed them.</p>

<p>There was no way to describe that one. There was only height,
and slenderness quick as moonlight, and eyes like arrows. Of
colors, there was none, the way there gleamed from her only a
thick, resplendent whiteness, like the braiding together of all
colors. And there was pride, desire, sultriness, and danger, the
way she was the body of that unending Night.</p>

<p>‘I cannot say,’ whispered Agnes. ‘But she descends the
stair as if she were walking down the sky.’</p>

<p>Then Agnes could look no more upon the lady, but lowered her
eye to the human face of Mielusine. Then she saw at
Mielusine’s side another: Eudemarec. His look was that of a
man whose thoughts are far away.</p>

<p>Arianna raised her arm. Agnes heard the opening of the great
doors of the abbey onto the Night.</p>

<p>‘You know your tasks,’ Arianna called out to her bandits:
‘Now go!’</p>

<p>And with a wild whooping and a clattering of swords and
spurs, the robbers went into the night. Where the Swan Boats
waited to ferry them over, nine at a turn.</p>

<p>Agnes fell back into the gloom of the closet. A greenish,
yellowish, bluish anti-image of the scene was burning in her
eyes, filled by the lady of the lough.</p>

<p>‘So that is my enemy,’ she murmured.</p>

<p>‘It is for her sake your work is undone,’ Mac Bride said.
‘Each darkness Arianna is sending her bandits across the lough
to fulfill her wild kailees. And when they return from their
kailees, their boots are black with mud from the bogs, and they
dirty the steps worse than they did the time before, the way it
is their great delight to outdo themselves incessantly.’</p>

<p>‘But what is this Arianna, and how did she win such power?
Why do they follow her?’</p>

<p>The countryman laughed. ‘Ah now, as to that, there are as
many different tales as you could waste your time in counting!
But Miss, this is the Night-land, and you must learn to think as
do the Night-folk. These men and ladies come into Arianna’s
service because she is ours. It’s her beauty has drawn us here
– and by that word you must understand more than any eye could
see. <i>Why</i>, do you ask? Because it pleases
<i>her</i>.’</p>

<p>‘I do not understand,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘When you do, it’s free of this place you’ll be,’ he
answered her.</p>

<p>It was late when the countryman led Agnes back to her bed to
rest. ‘You’ll be finding me where the lamps are burning,’
he told her. ‘It’s in charge of the fires I am.’ Then he
let her be.</p>

<p>In the dark, low hall, half-buried in the crannog, Agnes
undressed to her shift and crept into her cot just inside the
door. She listened for awhile to the sounds of the girls filling
the hall with their unspeakable dreams. From far away, through
the windows set under the ceiling like milky eyes, the music of
the abbey and the beat of dancing feet was reaching her.</p>

<p>Agnes fell a-dreaming of the procession, the maids, and the
unutterable lady of the lough. Toward the darkness’ end she
was turning in the cot, her hair streaming from one side to the
other. And once she whispered a name aloud: ‘Aengus!’</p>

<h2><a name="ch18"></a> 18. How the Maid Entered the Court</h2>

<p class="first">ONCE IN MOONLIGHT, whenas all the abbey folk
were asleep other than gamblers and servants, the dark man in
the dark gray cóta mór went striding round the crannog at the
water’s edge. Three times he went round the crannog, going
against the sun.</p>

<p>When he stopped he stood in the shadow of the ruined
bell-tower. Slow now, the dark man raised his head and looked up
to the tower. From the ground the bell-tower was rising into the
whiteness of the mist, and vanishing away.</p>

<p>The dark man stepped forward, and laid his hand on the
age-old stones of the bell-tower. Long and lean and sinewy was
that hand, and the bones showed in it like bolts and rods of
iron.</p>

<p>The dark man looked about from under the brim of his tricorn,
and satisfied himself that no others went about. He shifted
about his bow and his pouch of arrows on his back. Then he
reached up higher, and let his fingers sink into the cracks
between the stones, and he drew himself up. He reached up then
with his left hand, higher still, and dug the tips of his
fingers into the cracks between his stones, and drew himself
higher.</p>

<p>Hand over hand the dark man climbed the wall of the
bell-tower. The mist wrapped round him and swallowed him up.</p>

<p>Old Meg went by, between checking on her girls; she tarried
by the bell-tower, and looked up that way; she saw nothing there
of the dark man, the way he was hidden already in the high
mist.</p>

<p>And the mist brightened and whitened around the dark man
climbing. It was to the uppermost airs of the mist he had
climbed; climbed higher still; climbed out into the moonlight
air above the mist.</p>

<p>Over his head was a great window open in the wall, under the
roof of the bell-tower. The end of a telescope was showing
there.</p>

<p>The dark man shifted his hands, and followed the cracks
between the stones in the wall, and went softly, and crept
around the window. He climbed up to the rooftop. Where he stood
breathing with heaviness, and unbending the iron bolts of his
fingers stained with the lichens from the age-old stones.</p>

<p>He leaned out over the parapet of the rooftop, and looked out
below. Below him the window opened, and he could see the
telescope, and hear the sighs of the man languishing within.</p>

<p>The dark man in the dark gray cóta mór smiled, and sat
tailor-fashion on the stones, and began his vigil on the
bell-tower. </p>

<p class="break">AS TO EUDEMAREC now, he wasted his hours
gambling, the way there was nothing else to be interesting him.
Maybe it was because he didn’t care, but he was winning all
his hands and enriching himself; he enjoyed to spend his
winnings adorning the dancers he welcomed to his bed.</p>

<p>Once he spent a whole moon gaming; he took the bank and went
on winning; then he was losing, and then winning again. Maid
Buan, the proud one, was wagering hard against him.</p>

<p>Eudemarec knew Maid Buan well by now: she was always coming
into the gaming hall and gambling away the treasures men were
showering upon her for her favors, vainly; and she would
challenge hardest whatever man won the most that moon, the way
she found him shining with the glory of the luck of all his
winnings, and handsome, and it seemed the moon glow shone on and
gathered round and round him. On this moon, the glow was shining
on Eudemarec’s head and hands, and now she was striving with a
heart and a half to break his bank. But as to the Breton, no
thought was in his head outside of the cards and their numbers,
and he didn’t even know it when Maid Buan’s treasures were
depleted, and she turned on her heels with a fury and left; he
didn’t even know it when the Moon went down and the mist
darkened.</p>

<p>In the end he pushed back his chair away from the table, and
with deadly eyes stared at the piles of his winnings, gold and
silver coins, and rings and chains and chains.</p>

<p>He stifled a yawn in the back of his sleeve.</p>

<p>‘For Maid Mielusine’s bank,’ he said, and went out.</p>

<p>The lawns were still. It was almost the hour of moonrise
again. A few guests were hastening to catch the last ferry to
land. The ferrymen then put up their boats and went in to their
suppers.</p>

<p>The lough was murmuring gently. The fog was soft on the
Breton’s cheek. There was a sort of stillness, as of death.
Very slowly the mist brightened, and the waters of the lough
were brightening. In the county of mist, moonrise was never
known until after it had come.</p>

<p>Eudemarec looked into the silver in the lough.</p>

<p>‘Arianna,’ he breathed, as though taken by surprise with
the thought. ‘Arianna d’argent.’</p>

<p class="break">AT THAT TIME, Arianna had three maids, Maid
Buan, Maid Ferb, and Maid Niam. Each had charge of fifty maids,
and it was the way of them, that they would tend the wild
orchards round the lough. Maid Buan saw to the apples, Maid Ferb
to the pears, and Maid Niam had charge of the quinces.</p>

<p>Arianna herself kept a garden, luxuriant beyond all telling,
at one end of the crannog. And the fragrance that garden exhaled
into the dark airs of the Night, commingled with the mists of
the lough, and carried over the whole county.</p>

<p>Now as to Mielusine, she was waking and walking with the
Moon, and still evading the court. The Swan Boat did not cross
when the Moon was up, but Mielusine often looked across the
waters to the apple orchard, where the little grave was.</p>

<p>‘Ino, why am I here?’ she asked sadly. ‘What do I look
for?’</p>

<p>The banker laughed. ‘You’re looking for what many do,
Wood-Maid: a doorway back to Day.’</p>

<p>Mielusine sighed. ‘Yes, I don’t like the Night. It’s
sneaking and nasty.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t let the lady catch you saying that,’ warned the
dwarf.</p>

<p>It was Ino, convinced her at last to be showing herself at
court. While many bandits went roaming after adventure, others
attended Arianna. Each darkness the lady walked the crannog, and
the witchlights colored the mists, and threw long gleams across
the waters of the lough.</p>

<p>‘Mielusine,’ asked the lady, ‘why do you slander the
darkness?’</p>

<p>‘It’s only that it makes me shiver, ma’am,’ said
Mielusine, not daring look at Arianna’s magpie eyes.
‘There’s so much unseen in it.’</p>

<p>‘It is its virtue,’ answered Arianna. ‘Whatever you see
must be as it seems, and nothing else. There are no regrets in
Night.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, ma’am.’</p>

<p>‘We give no sanctuary here, Mielusine. You must join us or
go back.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot be going, ma’am! Where else can I learn of
love?’</p>

<p>The lady laughed a silvery laugh. ‘If you would stay, you
must be welcomed by the waters. It is a custom all here must
undergo.’</p>

<p>‘What shall I do?’</p>

<p>The lady led Mielusine to the water’s edge. That was on the
end of the crannog, and the vapor of the garden thick and warm
about them. The stones were piled high and steep about, like
skulls crowding up out of the lough: the water opened deep and
black beneath their feet.</p>

<p>Arianna pointed down into that sluggish mere.</p>

<p>‘Come the full Moon you’ll go into the lough or leave us,
little maid.’</p>

<p>The lady said those words on the dark of the moon. And it was
thirteen darknesses Mielusine had, to be going to the water’s
edge and looking down, and thinking up her fear. Until that
darkness came.</p>

<p>‘Go down into the lough, Mielusine, bring back a reed from
the lough bed, and tell us what you see there.’</p>

<p>The lady’s whisper burned the maid’s ears, and she
shuddered. ‘Those who lack courage cannot stay here,’
whispered Arianna wickedly. ‘The beasts will harm you only if
you wish them to.’</p>

<p>Mielusine looked up into Arianna’s eyes. Very small and
childlike Mielusine seemed, and the gentlemen and ladies
whispering among themselves, so sure that she would not survive
the trial.</p>

<p>Others helped her out of her gown, and naked as a pearl white
scarf shivering in the breeze, Mielusine stood on the rocky
edge. She had not even a shift on, not a stitch.</p>

<p>She could not swim a stroke, but thought to herself,
<i>Better to drown than suffer the taunts of the ladies,
laughing behind their fans.</i></p>

<p>She pinched her nose, did little Sini, and jumped.</p>

<p>For a time the cottager’s daughter was clinging to the
rock, and the water was lapping round her, and in the
witchlights the ladies of the court saw her kicking legs
flashing under the water. The ends of her hair were snakes
writhing on the surface. Then she went under, and the ladies saw
a glimmering deep down, but then it wavered and vanished among
the gleams of the witchlights on the waves.</p>

<p>Down into the oily blackness struggled Mielusine.</p>

<p>On the rocks the ladies took their ease awaiting her. Ino was
going among them, whispering into their ears. They all laughed
gracefully and maliciously to hear his words, and eagerly nodded
their agreements.</p>

<p>At first Mielusine closed her eyes, kicking and waving her
arms. But soon she found she could see, after a fashion, even in
the water.</p>

<p>Great shapes were moving past her, and with a shudder she
kicked away deeper. The water pressing against her, pushing her
back up, and herself fighting and fighting against it.</p>

<p>The water broke, and Maid Mielusine paddled to the rock.
Arianna herself stretched down her hand to her.</p>

<p>‘Give me the reed, and tell us how you fared.’</p>

<p>Mielusine shivered. Her hair slid straight and slick down her
back. Her small, narrow face was gleaming in the torchlight, and
she had never looked so lovely. Her slender trembling arm held
up the lake-weed.</p>

<p>‘I went down,’ she said, gasping still. ‘The water
didn’t – didn’t want to let me. I remembered what you
said. The water seemed warmer, deep down. I went deeper.</p>

<p>‘On the bottom was a green and golden light. I took the
reed. Then I saw a blue maiden lying on the sand. She was
dressed all in flowers, and very beautiful. She was curled up on
her side, and pillowed her face on her hands. Her eyes and her
mouth were smiling in a dream. Then I had no breath, and swam up
with the bubbles.’</p>

<p>‘Welcome,’ said Lady Arianna, and drew Maid Mielusine
lightly up beside her. Straightway some minxes came forward to
dry Mielusine and dress her again.</p>

<p>‘Who was the maiden?’ asked Mielusine.</p>

<p>‘One who died and never found her lover,’ answered
Arianna.</p>

<p>‘What was her name? Does everyone see her so?’</p>

<p>‘Each sees something different, now come, eat and rest,’
whispered the dwarf in her ear. ‘The lady showed you great
favor, don’t try her patience! See the jewels I’ve won! I
wagered the ladies that you would pass the test, and now half
these shall be yours.’</p>

<p>Ino laughed wickedly, and danced a little jig.</p>

<p>Then Mielusine was kissed by the bandits and minxes of the
abbey, and they made a feast, with dancing and singing, and
named that darkness after Mielusine, seating her in the seat of
honor in the casino hall.</p>

<p>None of them noticed the solitary figure in the shadows by
the door. She was but a girl of the maidservants, and of the
least of them, winning no favor, the way she was still wearing
the homespun dress of her village: and its hem black and ragged
from the dirty work she did.</p>

<p>When all the court had passed, the girl stepped out from
shadow, and resumed her pacing round the isle. The gamesters
were in the gaming-rooms, the robbers out on their lickerish
quests, the maids in the orchards, the gentlefolk in the hall,
and Arianna gone alone into her garden. Only the maidservant
strode the outer grounds between the abbey and the waves.</p>

<p>She rounded the servants’ building. She went past the dark
pens where Arianna’s fifty hunting hounds were pent,
scratching at the ground, snuffing at the vapor of the garden,
whining hungrily.</p>

<p>She went across the lawns to the crannog’s end, and by
chance she lingered to a stop at the water’s edge where the
maid had had her trial.</p>

<p>There she stayed, looking down into water.</p>

<p>She was thinking, perhaps, of the lovers she had spied about
the crannog, kissing in dark corners. Perhaps she was wondering
what made the lovers so happy.</p>

<p>And wasn’t she wondering, too, whether herself would ever
again be happy?</p>

<p>She had been angry as a girl, with poverty and the pride of
her parents, who would not accept the English, or change their
church. She had been thankful to the old man who had lifted her
out of that poverty. She’d had moments of gladness by him,
surely: when he gave her a horse or new gowns, or took her off
to London. But happiness, now?</p>

<p>The maidservant sighed, and kicked a stone into the water; it
vanished underneath the ink. She looked on her palm, on the
black spot there.</p>

<p>Her one time of happiness was when the Night first fell. What
did it matter that he had made a spell to give her that? And he
was dead, now: she herself had seen him dead and buried.</p>

<p>The boatmen at the mooring-poles watched the bandits laughing
and rushing into the casino. Through the doors voices were
reaching them, welcoming them, raised in a song to honor
Mielusine; and the singing filled the crannog, so that the
bandits did not even notice, far away beyond the hounds’ pens,
beyond the kitchens and Arianna’s garden walls, the small
upright figure pensive on the lough.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19"></a>19. How Arianna Hunted</h2>

<p class="first">THEREAFTER, when the maids went to the
orchards, Mielusine went with them. She did not go to tend to
the trees, the way she was a dancer. But she stopped at the edge
of the apple trees, by a little mound of fresh-turned earth; and
she was singing little songs over it, and tending the grave of
Master Aengus.</p>

<p>She planted an apple there, so that his soul should grow up
into that tree, and in after years she might talk to him in the
branches.</p>

<p>Once in the village she asked after Lady Agatha. ‘The mad
creature? Surely she pined away for grief, poor thing. Och,
’tis evil, this Night!’</p>

<p>The girl who’d given Agatha her place in the Swan Boat
Mielusine did not meet, the way that one had not returned to the
village, but had met with one of the robbers, and ridden away
with him over the hills; he returned to the abbey with the
emerald in his glove, but without the girl.</p>

<p>Mielusine passed only an hour under the orchards; then she
went to the dancing-masters, to her lessons. She wondered when
she should again see Vasquez. Ino had told her this much, that
‘the rascal ran overmuch into debt, and is in hiding till he
pay enough not to get his throat cut on sight!’</p>

<p>Mielusine hoped she might be seeing him soon. When she lay in
her bed she thought of him, and of what he looked like beneath
his ugly mask.</p>

<p class="break">AGNES WENT to the stairs before the moon rose.
Soon the witchlights dimmed, and the bandits were in bed, and
the Hundred Steps and a Step blacker than the moon before.</p>

<p>Agnes sighed, kneeled before the first step, spilled soap and
water across it, and set to scrubbing.</p>

<p>A few passed her on the stair, servants, lovers, and
gamesters keeping all hours. At first Agnes had stared at them,
as if her look might have made their heels less dirty; now she
didn’t glance up, even when one stopped and lingered.</p>

<p>She went on working, eying the muddy shoes out of the corner
of her eye. Let him gape! Her skin had thickened by now.</p>

<p>‘Agatha?’ was asked.</p>

<p>The brushes halted in her hand. A sort of shiver ran up her
arm. Her heart was beating very fast, and she had no wish other
than to be hiding in some dark place. Then she sighed, shook
back her dank locks, and looked him in the eye.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Eudemarec. It’s me you’re seeing here.’</p>

<p>‘My lady, what are you doing?’</p>

<p>She smiled wearily at the outrage in his voice. ‘Cleaning
the steps, to be sure. Or trying to.’</p>

<p>‘But why?’ He stooped to offer her his hand, but she hid
her hands in her skirts.</p>

<p>‘It’s here I was directed,’ she answered. ‘It’s my
task.’</p>

<p>‘I will put an end to this,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Please do not. I will finish this! And if they learn who I
was, it’s out from the isle they’ll put me.’</p>

<p>He sat on the step above her, laying his arms out on his
knees. He regarded her closely. Then he laughed, gloomily,
shaking his head. ‘Is there nothing I can do for you,
then?’</p>

<p>‘No, nought beyond giving me the pleasure of your speech
for a moment, and telling me how you are,’ she said, stooping
once more to her duty.</p>

<p>‘Ah, as for me now, what should I tell you? This is my
nature, to be laughing when the outlook’s bleakest, and to be
saddest when all goes well. But tell me now: will you forgive me
for the deed I did?’</p>

<p>She looked gravely into his sea-gray eyes.</p>

<p>‘Aye,’ she was murmuring. ‘He was meant to die here.
And ’twas my doing more than yours. You were no more than an
arrow I loosed at him.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry for it now. It was a fool’s errand. Do you
miss him very much?’</p>

<p>She bent over the brush again, scrubbing hard.
‘Enough.’</p>

<p>For a long time silence went between them, and only the sound
of the bristles chafing at the bandits’ dirt. Then he said,
softly, ‘I killed Mablaith with the same shot. It was only
your Aengus could have brought back the Sun. Now none of the
Sleepers will ever be waking.</p>

<p>‘Already Mablaith seems dim to me, as if she had been
someone in a tale I heard. And—’ he reached out for the post
of the rail, and grasped it. ‘And my heart goes out to
Arianna.’</p>

<p>Agnes took hold of the Breton’s knee. ‘Beware of that
one.’</p>

<p>A bit of a smile haunted his lips. ‘I’m a gambler at
heart, Agatha. And the dream of any gambler is to set a copper
against a fortune in gold, and win.’</p>

<p>‘She is cold and cruel,’ said Agnes.</p>

<p>‘She is as beautiful as a snowfall in the Moon,’ he
answered. ‘Her body has the strength of the brightest scian.
What does it matter that I am an apostate, a very atheist, since
I forsook my father and loved Mablaith in the wood? The game on
the tables no longer appeases me. I would wager all I have,
against the highest good Night can offer.</p>

<p>‘For now, the highwayman Gwangior is her champion; but
’tis said she’s tiring of him, and casting about for her
next love. I will win her favor, or else I care not what befalls
me.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Agatha,’ he went on, softly, for the pleasure of
speaking his secret: ‘Every darkness I venture forth to be the
one whose tale entertains her the most. Every darkness she’s
asking me: “Eudemarec, what have you to say now?” And I hang
my head and answer, “I’ve nothing at all to say.”
“Faith, the honor of Brittany is lagging!” she says then,
and all the robbers, gentlemen and ladies, laugh.</p>

<p>‘And for all that, I swear there is a twinkle in her look,
meant only for my eyes. She is starting to love me, Agatha: and
her love for me will not end as all her other loves have ended,
but it will outlast the Night.’</p>

<p>Agnes did not answer. She went on brushing and washing the
step. After a long while, he was taking his leave of her,
promising to come speak with her again.</p>

<p>Agnes looked up after him, watching him go out by the little
servants’ door, the way the main doors were shut and locked
while the moon shone.</p>

<p>There was a great pity in her eyes.</p>

<p class="break">WHEN THE MOON ROSE, the crannog was quiet, save
for the clink of coins from the gamblers in their house, and the
whispering of the serving girls. The dark man in the cóta mór
strode about the grounds, walking from shadow to shadow, pausing
now and again and standing still, as though he were listening or
looking for something. But whenever he heard steps coming near
him, the dark man slipped back into a shadow.</p>

<p>That moon a lady came to the abbey.</p>

<p>She walked up the way the moonglow was shining for her,
through the mist, to the main doors. Now, it happened that on
that moonrise someone had forgotten to close the main doors to
the abbey. There they were, standing wide open, and the lady
walked up into the entranceway.</p>

<p>She wore a long black dress that covered her up, arms and
all, in black, and left only her bosom bare. Over her head she
wore a long black veil, tucked under her chin, wound round her
throat and trailing down behind her. Her hands were covered in
black gloves. At her side came a man, and a fine bravo he was,
swaggering in with a saber at his side.</p>

<p>Agnes paused in her washing of the steps, and watched the
lady at the entranceway. After a time some rogues and wenches
appeared from the gaming hall, and greeted the lady with many
fine words and flourishes. ‘Lady Ann!’ they were saying.
‘Lady Ann, welcome back to you, won’t you be joining
us?’</p>

<p>The lady nodded lazily, and followed the robbers and trollops
out. As she passed the steps, Lady Ann’s eye fell on Agnes,
and Agnes met her gaze stare for stare; then the lady was gone,
and her bravo’s boots were echoing down the passage after
her.</p>

<p>It seemed to Agnes she had seen the lady once before, but she
couldn’t remember where.</p>

<p class="break">MAID MIELUSINE was walking about the abbey in
the moonlight, going into the untrod places, pausing before the
shadowy corners, and she would never have told herself that it
was the rogue Vasquez she was hoping to be encountering. But
when she saw him, then all at once she knew it.</p>

<p>He bowed to her in an overdone sweep, and put back his
tricorn over the top of his grinning mask and silver hair.
‘Delighted,’ he said, ‘to find you again, Maid Snowflake.
Will you walk a ways with me?’ Not waiting for an answer, he
took her arm and started forward.</p>

<p>Along the way she was thinking of what she should be saying
to him, when he cast a look back over his shoulder, and
unthinking Mielusine asked, ‘What’s there, Mr Vasquez?’</p>

<p>He answered, ‘Oh, I only caught sight of a few of my
creditors a while back, and I’d be just as happy not to have
any words with them just now. Beside of which, I’m glad for
the chance to talk with yourself, Maid Snowflake. You’ve been
on my mind,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Have I, Mr Vasquez?’</p>

<p>Her breathing was troubled, her face hot and cold by turns,
and it seemed to her that her steps were awkward and ill-placed
with every step.</p>

<p>Side by side they were walking, and all at once she noticed
that he was holding her hand in his; and it was done so
smoothly, and felt so natural, that she hadn’t even been aware
of the moment when the thing was done, and had it been him
taking her hand, or her taking hold of his? This thought made
her burn, and she envied him the safety of his mask, and she was
looking away across the water and feeling she ought to be saying
something and that they ought to be speaking, the way their
silence was too eloquent of itself.</p>

<p>So ‘From what part of Spain are you from, Mr Vasquez?’
she asked him; to which he laughed and answered, ‘From no part
of it at all, Maid Snowflake, but it was this blessed bit of an
island saw me born and raised. And my name isn’t Vasquez at
all, but of my true name I’ve no more of a notion than
yourself, the way my natural parents didn’t see fit to own me.
They gave me up at birth, and I was a foundling child, not so
very far from here as things go.’</p>

<p>Then he was asking after her birth and upbringing. To such
questions the maid had prepared many a glamorous answer, but to
this man she could only tell him the truth of herself, little
Sini, and her sisters Grisalta and Merrwyn.</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ he answered, ‘I’d have liked to have known your
sisters, you make them sound so appealing,’ and Mielusine bit
her lip, thinking he was right to say so, and that her sisters
were beautiful, and put her to shame even to be speaking of
them.</p>

<p>‘Faith, my own home life was no finer,’ he said lazily,
seeming unaware of her confusion. ‘The way my foster father
was only a countryman, but a farmer of his own land at least,
and never a tenant on an English lord’s lands.’</p>

<p>‘But how is it everyone calls you with a Spanish name?’
she asked.</p>

<p>He paused in his step, and tossed a stone out into the lough,
and gestured across it with a cípín to the village lights
across the way. ‘It happened out there, outside of the mists,
in Ireland,’ he said. And for the first time she heard pain
and anger back of the laughter in his voice.</p>

<p>‘My foster father went to war against the English at Boyne,
like all proper men of blood and fire – not that they were
victorious for all that, or for all that their cause was the
just one of their own freedom and homeland. And ever after,’
said Vasquez, ‘I held it hard against the English, the way I
was sure that my own father had fought against them and fallen,
and that, lacking their taxes and rents and takings of land to
feed their King’s men’s appetites, my own father and mother
would have been glad to keep me and raise me in comfort and
honor. Instead I was bred up like an alien child in a drafty
poor farmhouse, and saw my foster father old and broken after
his defeat, and not even brave enough to flee. And my foster
brother was not much better, studying all night like a priest,
and not daring to raise his eyes against the English lords.</p>

<p>‘But myself now,’ he said, ‘I minded me of my true
parentage, and I raised my eyes against the lords, and more than
my eyes, and I was fighting them at every turn, until in the end
the King’s law hounded me, and I had to flee across the sea.
First I went into France, where so many of the princes of
Ireland had gone to after Boyne; but I drifted farther away,
hating even to be looking on the sea that lapped the English
shores. I went into Spain, and took to calling myself Vasquez,
though it wasn’t until this Night that anyone was believing I
was Vasquez, though I am, as yourself can plainly see, one of
the Black Irish, and dark as any man from Granada. And my
blood,’ he said with a rueful little laugh, ‘runs as
hot.’</p>

<p>And as if to prove it was so, he stretched his arm out over
the water, and caught a snowflake in his weather-strong palm;
and straight away the snowflake burned to water on his dark
skin.</p>

<p>There followed a silence. At length Maid Mielusine put her
hand out and let it rest on his shoulder. She was feeling a
longing to be alongside him, and comfort him for all his pains
and dreadful, manly hatreds burning away in him and disfiguring
him underneath his laughter and jests.</p>

<p>He rose of a sudden, cast aside the cípín, and led her
away. Before them the ground of the crannog stretched to its
farthest point, where the lady’s garden was, and the byre of
her hunting hounds. Vasquez stopped of a sudden, and looked
back. She stopped along with him.</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ she asked.</p>

<p>He wasn’t answering at first, but still stared back. The
Moon was almost fallen, and much of the abbey was sunk in gloom,
and the first of the witchlights, floating about the abbey’s
walls, were sparking and starting to glow, but not lighting the
shadows much.</p>

<p>‘I thought I saw someone.’</p>

<p>He turned back to her. And then the eyes in his mask fell on
her as if they saw her for the first time, and she swayed
slightly forward, closer into his body, so that she could feel
the warmth of his chest in its nearness to her breast, and she
bit her lip, and right away stopped that, the way he was looking
now at her lips and her mouth, and she didn’t know whether to
close it or smile with it, only it felt suddenly huge and
ungainly spread across the lower half of her face; all of Lady
Agatha’s lessons were lost to her then; she found herself
leaning forward even more, and he was bending and inclining
towards her, and she saw his firm full mouth, and resolute chin,
under the shadow of his mask. He turned his head and looked
away.</p>

<p>‘Who’s there?’ he muttered, and she heard a note of
danger in his voice.</p>

<p>He took a step back and drew his cloak across his shoulders.
Mielusine looked.</p>

<p>‘It’s no one at all,’ she answered, but he was gone,
and already swiftly striding through the mists at the end of the
crannog, and turning beyond the lady’s garden past the
byre.</p>

<p>Then she was ashamed, and for a moment she wanted to run
after him, only her feet wouldn’t move at all, and she looked
back in terror at the abbey. She saw a dark, tall, and lean
shape emerging out of the gloom, attended by seven of the
swimming witch fires.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ she said, ‘It’s only Mr Mac Bride, who has
charge of all the fires and candles here. He’s not a creditor
of anyone.’</p>

<p>But the sight of him, and the thought of herself white and
nearly naked, alone on the ground by the water’s edge, shamed
her and shamed her for what she’d been desiring, and she went
back into the abbey, and didn’t follow after Mr Vasquez. And
it was a long time, she was feeling guiltily, before she’d be
seeing him again.</p>

<p class="break">BUT IT WAS NOT Mac Bride alone. For the way of
it was, an hour earlier, in Arianna’s bedchamber at the top of
the tower, Gwangior, her champion, awoke. And he reached for the
lady, but she was not there in that room. And he found his hand
bare: there was no ring upon his finger.</p>

<p>Then he knew that she had cast him off.</p>

<p>And all at once fear took hold of Gwangior, who had never
known fear in all his thieving life; and he shuddered and shook,
and threw on clothing and fled down the Hundred Steps and a
Step, and out into the mists; it was his frantic footsteps
Vasquez heard.</p>

<p>And Gwangior found a Swan barge waiting, and a ferryman at
the ready for him, despite the hour. Gwangior searched the
boatman’s face; there was nought but stone to see there, and
never any feeling at all. It was as though the man saw nothing
before him other than a dead man, and a set of bones.</p>

<p>Gwangior shook all over, as if with ague.</p>

<p>But in the heights of the tower, Arianna let clothe herself,
and she clothed herself in soft-tanned leather, with a jaunty
cocked cap; and she took up a bow, and arrows.</p>

<p>And Arianna went down to her pen, to her hounds. There she
let drop a shirt that she had herself stripped from Gwangior’s
chest whenas they twined together: all stained with his sweat
and his scent it was.</p>

<p>‘There, my darlings, you know what you are to do now, do
you not?’ she purred; and all the hounds leapt at her skirts.
And the lady Arianna passed with her hounds across the lough,
and in the darkness of the mists somewhere in the orchards,
amidst the wild apples, pears and quinces, there were dark
doings and the sound of a man screaming, screaming without end,
full of bloody horror and pain, until at last it fell stop, and
was drowned in the howling of ferocious hounds.</p>

<p>And all dainty and trim, Arianna returned to the crannog, and
behind her the ferryman poled the Swan barge, bringing back the
torn and mangled body of Gwangior. In the boat before, Arianna
sat calmly, and daubed with her kerchief at her tears.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20"></a>20. Of the Dancer</h2>

<p class="first">FOR SIX DARKNESSES of the moon the witchlights
were swimming low about the grounds, shrunken and dim; the
candles went unlit, and merriments were suspended. And Arianna
dressed darkly, darkly veiled, mourning Gwangior, who had been
in the day the fiercest highwayman in the British Isles.</p>

<p>For a time Agnes gained upon the steps, the way the robbers
weren’t going out on their kailees. She reached as far as the
thirteenth step; she’d never seen so many clean at once.
Eudemarec came to pay her a call from time to time, and his
words lightened her labor. But it was not long to last.</p>

<p>When the candles were burning again, the witchlights swam up
higher in the air, and the robbers were dressing more boldly
than ever, if that was possible. Many were going to the dancing
hall, to watch the dancers practicing: reels and wild jigs,
contradances, quadrilles, minuets, pavanes – all the elder
dances, and the ones they were creating. In the day the dancing
hall had been the Lady Chapel. Huge it was and starry bright,
the way the fishy witchlights loved to swim high up under the
stone ribs of the arches.</p>

<p>All the dancers practiced hard, most of all the nine who were
the lady’s wards, the way their time was coming. ‘Let you
wait, now,’ they were whispering, and laughing slyly at
Mielusine, who didn’t understand. ‘Wait for a masquerade!’
Mielusine was grateful for a moment of rest now and again, the
way her legs were sore and burning.</p>

<p>On the close of that moon, while the robbers fared abroad on
their kailees, the Swan Boat put out onto the lough. Aboard were
three: two ferrymen, and a third figure clouded in a dark red
cloak. They poled out so deep in the mist they were not seen
from the crannog at all. The middle figure slipped out of the
dark red cloak and sank into the waters of the lough, sank deep
into the black waters of the lough.</p>

<p>Later on, the Swan Boat was poled back to the crannog. Two
ferrymen poled the boat, and between them stood the Lady of the
Lough, holding a reed, and it was white-naked she was, standing
in the belly of the boat. Her face was pale as a new lamb’s
pelt, and her dark hair streaming wetly down her back, and her
body small as a virgin’s. She gave the reed to a man standing
at the edge of the crannog, and he bowed to her and welcomed her
into a great, warm, mantling cloak; the color of the cloak was
as silver as herself.</p>

<p>‘Let her bless you, young lady,’ said Mac Bride, the way
it was himself welcoming her. The old man bent like a stork, and
kissed her two hands.</p>

<p>‘Only you, Mac Bride?’ she asked him, very calmly. ‘I
was looking for another.’ Then naked under the warm white
cloak, she passed him up the crannog unseen into the lady’s
garden, and the silver-chased gate shut fast behind her.</p>

<p>The ferrymen nodded to the old countryman, the way they were
mute; he gave them silver coins and sent them back to the
landing; himself he walked round the circle of the crannog three
times with a lantern in his hand, cleansing it free of all
sin.</p>

<p>He never knew – or did he, now? – of the black-shadowed
niche in the abbey wall, where someone was standing watching
him. Agnes held her breath, and watched him pass. When the
witchlights were fading, she went back into the abbey and to the
Hundred Steps and a Step. And she never told Mac Bride of seeing
him circling the crannog, nor of anything else she’d seen.</p>

<p class="break">THE WINTER was long, it lingered all year, and
the weather held cold and black, and snow ever falling out of
mist over the lough. Only the wan lights of the village,
reflecting off the water amongst the reeds and sedge, showed
there was any world at all beyond the crannog. By an open window
in the dancing room, Mielusine would go gazing into the lough,
resting upon a high railing in the wind, thankful for its
coolness.</p>

<p>Eudemarec had told her of Agatha. ‘Will you not help me
keep her spirits up?’ he had asked. ‘For she must be surely
lonely, toiling the long hours at her endless task.’</p>

<p>Why, she was wondering, would she not see Agatha? The answer
was coming to her, only this, that she had betrayed her teacher.
But she didn’t know how.</p>

<p>When the Moon rose, the other dancers went to their beds, hot
baths, and suppers with their lovers. Mielusine lingered over
the lough, warming herself in a velvet cloak Ino had given her
out of their winnings. Mielusine understood that she was wealthy
now, the richest of the wards, with as much money in her bank as
the boldest bandits. She didn’t know what that meant, and
little she cared, though she was glad to see Ino rubbing his
hands and dancing his jigs at their fortune.</p>

<p>Little flakes of snow were wetting her cheeks, and she turned
and went in, the way she knew the Moon now was somewhere up in
the blackness behind the clouds.</p>

<p>She went out to the coiling stair and looked at the woman on
the steps. That one had all her mind on the third step,
scrubbing and rinsing and scrubbing again in the sallow light of
a greasy candle.</p>

<p>For a time the Maid was lingering by the hangings, watching.
She thought, <i>Surely she is much changed from the time I knew
her in the wood. But how? Perhaps that she is younger</i>.</p>

<p>The woman on the step heaved her shoulders, stood and carried
out her pail for fresh water. Mielusine stepped behind the
hanging.</p>

<p>Back once more in the silent, solemn hall, Mielusine lighted
a candle at the edge of the stage. The witchlights were dark,
and only a hint of the moonlight gleamed off the leading in the
colored windows high up in the walls of the ancient Lady Chapel.
She thought of Vasquez. How long it had been since she’d seen
him!</p>

<p>Already Lughnasadh had gone by, and the rogues and minxes had
laughingly all made their handfastings, moons and moons ago.
Soon, too soon, Mielusine would have to dance before the lady
and the court; and she wasn’t ready at all. She stepped up on
stage, took off her cloak, and began to dance. Round and round
she flew, and it seemed to her that for the very first time she
was getting the reel right, and showing some grace; and the
prettiness of her gestures was entering into her. And the
prettier she felt, the lonelier she felt, so that it was like a
great ache inside her, black and chilling as the wet outside the
windows.</p>

<p>‘You will always know love, Mielusine,’ Lady Agatha told
her once. ‘You like a man, you fancy him; still and all it is
not love, the way you are doing what you want. Then he is on
your mind; it isn’t that you want to be thinking about him,
indeed you don’t; all the same you do. You are bound by a
fever, and you’ll not want to think it love, the way it comes
only from your blood and the edges of your bones.</p>

<p>‘Is it love , you are asking? If you are afraid, then it is
love.’</p>

<p>Mielusine stopped her dance of a sudden. She heard someone
clapping in the darkness beyond the stage. She skipped to
retrieve her cloak and hide herself.</p>

<p>‘Who is it? Who’s there?’ she called.</p>

<p>A figure emerged, ruddy in the candlelight. The man stopped
clapping, picked up the candle, and offered Mielusine his hand.
He wore only a wide sleeved shirt and muddy riding breeches. His
hair was clubbed and powdered. She could not see his face, the
way he wore a bodach mask, and it the most grotesque and
ridiculous the maid had ever seen.</p>

<p>‘It is Maid Mielusine, is it not? You’re damned pretty,
dancing here alone on a dark moon!’</p>

<p>‘Hello, Mr Vasquez,’ she said.</p>

<p class="break">AGNES found a cat upon the steps, intrigued by
the smell of the soap. She was a fat, white puss, with long
hair, a small face, blue eyes, and a tight black collar.</p>

<p>Agnes set down the pail, smiling.</p>

<p>‘Well-met, puss!’ she exclaimed. ‘Did Mac Bride bring
you from the manor? He never told me so.’</p>

<p>The cat bounded up in her lap, asking Agnes to scratch her
chin. Agnes caressed her. The cat’s droning song reminded her
of happier times.</p>

<p>‘How sleek is your coat! Now, someone has been brushing and
combing you, taking great care; and I know Mac Birdie was never
doing any such thing as that.’</p>

<p>Agnes frowned, stroking the cat. She looked out the window.
High up, the walls of the bell-tower were dim and dark in the
snow. It was said the Bacach had had his rooms there, when he
lived.</p>

<p>The pails, the brushes, and the rags Agnes put away in the
closet; and carrying the cat in her arms like a child against
her breast, she went out into the snow, crossed to the tower,
and began to climb into the dark.</p>

<p class="break">‘DO NOT STOP,’ said Vasquez. ‘Dance
again. Dance for me now.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ breathed Mielusine.</p>

<p>She slung the cloak from her shoulders and began to dance for
him. He moved with her, holding the candle between them, the
better to be watching her. Mielusine was looking into his eyes
in the mask, paying no mind to her steps. Her body had no weight
at all.</p>

<p>He set the candle on the floor and took her hands. ‘Now let
you dance <i>with</i> me,’ he said. So they did.</p>

<p>He was holding her very close, and through her shift she was
feeling the heat of him. And watching. What would his kiss taste
of? Would it be sweet like cake, biting like porter, or fresh
like a pear?</p>

<p>‘Come,’ he murmured, wrapping her in her cloak. ‘Do not
dress. All are resting save the gamblers; none will see
you.’</p>

<p>They went onto the dark lawns by the lough. For awhile they
were walking in the snowy mist, not speaking, only walking in
the snowy mist.</p>

<p>He leaned up against her, pressing her upon a iron gate. His
mask was dark against the smearing lights of the village far
away across the lough.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ she breathed, ‘do you always wear this
mask?’</p>

<p>He kissed her ear and answered, softly, ‘The way I cannot
rest, Maid Snowflake.’</p>

<p>‘But do you never dream?’</p>

<p>‘To dream,’ he laughed, ‘perchance to sleep.’</p>

<p>‘It’s sad,’ she said, ‘you make me. Who can cheat his
dreams and not go mad?’</p>

<p>‘I am mad,’ he answered, kissing her. ‘What else would
you be asking of a will o’ the wisp, a Beltane child, a
Tinker’s foundling?’</p>

<p>She could feel his breath, hot and dry on her cheek. He was
stroking her hair, her cheek, her throat, her breast.</p>

<p>‘Not here,’ she said. ‘…the dogs…’</p>

<p>It was by the pens of the lady’s hounds they were. She
heard their scratching and whining very close.</p>

<p>‘Old friends of mine,’ he muttered in her ear. ‘I
brought you here to show them. Go on – show my friends how
pretty you are!’</p>

<p>He turned her round, dropping her cloak. In the gloom she saw
the hundred white eyes of the hounds, their dark red ears, and
their pink tongues licking the night. Herself she was gleaming,
pressed against the iron in her dancing dress.</p>

<p>The dress they all were practicing dancing in, it was a silk
shift open for freedom of movement, nothing at all, and compared
to it nakedness would have seemed chaste. The stinging flakes
bit straight through it, dizzying Mielusine. Vasquez slipped two
fingers beneath the ribbons of the shift, sliding them off her
shoulders; she crossed her arms just in time to catch it at the
tips of her breasts.</p>

<p>Mielusine gasped.</p>

<p>She was feeling the warmth of him, smelling his flavor
mingling with the warm odors of the dogs and the icy sweet
smells of the lady’s garden. Slowly she let the shift slide
down her, its caress soft as Vasquez’ breath on her nape. She
kicked it aside, with a showy, dancer’s kick. His hands
streamed down her sides with the melting snow, and red naked she
leaned full against the iron bars, turned away from him,
reaching up to grip the top of the gate with both hands. The ice
cold metal kissed her cheek, her breasts, her thighs. She heard
him take a breath behind her, sharply like a kiss.</p>

<p>The dogs gathered round, whining and clawing the earth.
Mielusine felt no shame at it – she was burning, burning,
burning.</p>

<p>All at once she could hold no more, and her cramping fingers
broke from the iron.</p>

<p>‘Oh my Beloved,’ he said into her ear, ‘my Beloved, my
Beloved, my Beloved.’</p>

<p>She sank onto her velvet cloak. He was still kissing her,
very cleverly on her shoulder and throat, and she was sobbing
for the ache in her body and the sadness in her heart, the way
then at that moment, closer to this man than she had been to
anyone since she’d been an infant in the arms of her ma, she
was feeling alone in the world.</p>

<p>Still and all she was proud lying there on the snowy hard
ground before the gate, proud he had chosen her, proud of her
deed, and proud of her pleasure, of her pleasure above all.</p>

<p>After that moon, she went no more to the grave beside the
apple trees.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21"></a>21. Of the Bell-tower</h2>

<p class="first">AT THE TOP of the bell-tower was a door of oak,
and it cracked, dark, round at the top, and hinged with black
wrought iron. The latch too was of iron, cold under Agnes’
thumb.</p>

<p>For a time she was standing there, not making up her mind;
then the cat mewed. Agnes pressed the latch and entered the room
where Master Aengus had lived, when he lived here as Arianna’s
Bacach.</p>

<p>In the Bacach’s chambers books, papers, instruments,
dishes, linens and cushions were scattered about the floors. A
few lone embers shone red in a makeshift grate; at the left was
darkness, and black lines of a scaffolding beyond the bells.</p>

<p>It seemed someone had taken over his rooms after all.</p>

<p>The snow was ending, and a little starlight showing in the
night through the high openings, chopping the floor into black
and gray fragments. The bell-tower climbed above the mist, so
that the starlight could be seen shimmering on the top of the
mist as off a calm lake.</p>

<p>From the crannies over the bells came an ominous croaking, of
rooks in tangled nests.</p>

<p>The puss leapt down out of Agnes’ arms and ran across the
mess. She bounded up the scaffolding by a brass telescope to
settle in the lap of a man.</p>

<p>Daintily prancing, the puss was turning in the man’s lap,
and his hands scratching her ears, absent-like, until she curled
up, veiling her eyes in the plume of her tail.</p>

<p>The starlight shone off the white cat and the telescope. It
outlined the man’s dangling trouser-legs, and his shoes and
hands. The upper part of him, though, was darkness.</p>

<p>She was afraid of a sudden, with a great overmastering fear,
and she wanting nothing better than to be fleeing the place; her
throat was choking, strangling, and the words she would not
utter barely escaped her into the room:</p>

<p>‘Master Aengus!’</p>

<p>Something stirred up there, making no more sound than the
whir of a bird’s wings. Agnes felt eyes turning her way,
peering through the gloom. She was glad of the darkness for
this, that it spared him the sight of her stained worn skirts
and bare arms raw and red with soap.</p>

<p>‘Who are you calling for?’</p>

<p>The voice was rich and resonant, but softer than Aengus’
voice, less sharp, less knowing. It was the voice of a man is
dreaming all the time. But was it his voice?</p>

<p>‘You, now,’ she answered boldly.</p>

<p>Out the great window their voices were carrying, up above the
mist. The dark man on the rooftop leaned forward closer to the
edge, listening.</p>

<p>‘Why did you call me that?’</p>

<p>‘Surely it’s your name.’</p>

<p>He was silent a while. ‘Here they call me the Bacach. The
Lame One.’</p>

<p>‘What did they call you elsewhere?’</p>

<p>He was stroking the cat, drawing his fingers soft and slow
through the thick white fleece.</p>

<p>‘I don’t remember.’</p>

<p>She had seen him shot and buried. She’d moistened his grave
with her tears. But had that man been Aengus? She’d seen him
but dimly – he’d had the shape of Aengus, and not his shape.
And this one—</p>

<p>‘What do you remember?’</p>

<p>In the faint starlight his fingers were dark in the pale fur.
For a moment Agatha’s heart leapt, the way she thought she saw
the pallor of a scar on his inner wrist.</p>

<p>‘I remember a flood,’ he said softly. ‘Water rushing,
boiling up. I remember a cathedral of light, and the voices of
women singing, like angels, like sirens, sweet and
paradisiac.’</p>

<p>‘What else?’</p>

<p>‘Nought else.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing of – what you were before?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Did they not tell you what you were?’</p>

<p>The fingers clutched the cat’s fur. ‘They told me,’ he
answered, ‘that I am the murderer of the White Hind. Because
of me, she is no more seen about these isles.’</p>

<p>‘Aengus,’ she moaned, ‘and do you not know me?’</p>

<p>‘Why, surely I know you,’ he answered. ‘I’ve seen you
wandering about the lawns below, and the old countryman told me
your name. You’re Agnes who is washing the stair.’</p>

<p>‘And Lady Agatha?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘I know of a Lady Agatha,’ he said, sounding pleased to
be able to answer her. ‘She was in a story. There was a man in
love with her. But she didn’t love him back.’</p>

<p>‘What was the end of the story?’</p>

<p>He nudged the telescope, pointing it from star to star. It
was as if that old story did not interest him. He was forgetting
her already. ‘The man died. I don’t know what became of the
lady.’</p>

<p>After a while she went back out the door.</p>

<p>She trudged back to the Hundred Steps and a Step, each one
blacker than the rest with mud and muck ground into the
marble’s skin. They would never be cleaned, not by a hundred
hands working twenty years; they would stay black for ever and a
moon after. She stepped on them with her wooden shoes, scraping
their faces with her heels.</p>

<p>But something stopped her. The last step, now, did it look a
little bit less black than all the others to her eyes?</p>

<p>She thought to herself, <i>Master Aengus is alive.</i></p>

<p>And she stepped out the servants’ door and looked straight
up into the black ruin fading into mist.</p>

<p>‘I will win back your heart, Master Aengus. For all you
have forgotten now, the memory will come back to you, and myself
I will win back your heart.’</p>

<p class="break">IN THE MOONLIGHT the old countryman, Mac Bride,
was feeding the lady’s blood-hounds. He was holding a bucket
full of bloody scraps, and as the hounds ran round him leaping,
he was doling out the scraps, calling them all by name as though
they were his old friends: ‘Here, Francesco! Do you like that,
Estéban? Wag for it, Waltherius! Ho now, Cormac!’</p>

<p>The last scrap he saved for the smallest, a floppy-eared pup.
It was only recently Arianna had found a pup bold enough to be
one of her pack, so she’d let it into the pens with the rest,
and now her troop were fifty-one. She had named this latest
Gwangior.</p>

<p>Mac Bride left the hounds’ byre and washed his pail in the
lough.</p>

<p>When he stood up, the old man’s lean body rose like a pine
tree against the moon-path on the water. He called out in a soft
voice, speaking words older than Gaelic unto the fishes and
weeds clustering under the water at his feet. For a time Mac
Bride was listening. Strange was his face: a Firbolg’s
face.</p>

<p>He went into the pleasure hall by a back way, quietly round.
From a doorway he looked across to the woman bent over the
Hundred Steps and a Step.</p>

<p>For so many moons she had been toiling, and now she was
expert in her labor: the way the Moon was almost sunk, and she
had reached the seventh step.</p>

<p>Which if she cleaned, there would remain only ninety and four
to clean. And even so, come moonrise those seven would be black
as ever, and she would have to be starting all over again.</p>

<p>The old countryman was shaking his head in turning away, the
way he was hearing Agnes singing at her task.</p>

<p class="break">THAT MOON Agnes heard voices coming up off the
water. She left her work and drifted down closer to the edge.</p>

<p>The last Swan boat was ready by the mooring poles. A bravo of
a man was aboard, giving his hand to help aboard his lady. She
was dressed all in black, and her arms were swathed in black,
and her hands were in black gloves, and a black veil of lace was
wound round her face and trailing down her back. Only her bosom
was bare, and it was white as the moon outside the mists. The
lady and her bravo were laughing and bidding farewell to their
friends on the stones.</p>

<p>‘Lady Ann,’ called Agnes, ‘I know who you are.’</p>

<p>The lady fixed her eyes on her through the veils.</p>

<p>‘Do you now, my girl?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you remember me? It was I gave you jewels once,
and pins, in your home.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘was it you, now?’</p>

<p>‘You’re much changed.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you for it. Faith, the trinkets came in handy here
– how else would we have won all that we now have? But I’ll
pass you back all that’s remaining. I’ll throw it over to
you, can you catch it?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll catch it. But Lady Ann, what do you hear of the
children?’</p>

<p>‘The grawls?’ The lady’s peals of laughter rang out on
the water. ‘Well, and well! It’s the devil’s own time
they’re having of it, on their larks and wild kailees! Sing
them a song if you see them, my girl! Now farewell!’</p>

<p>‘Farewell, Lady Ann,’ she said. The couple’s friends
had gone up already into the abbey, and Agnes was standing by
the mooring poles alone, gazing into the mist brightening in the
moonglow. She took up what the lady had throw back to her, and
went back to her labor. All that moon she was working, but only
with half a heart, the way her eyes were always stealing back to
the beloved old book, with its spine worn smooth, hiding its
stories well-known to her heart.</p>

<p>Come darkness, Agnes went to her cot in the low hall where
the girls were dreaming. She was always the last in of those who
would be coming. She took off her woolen dress, smoothed her
shift and lay down into her cot. And she was so weary in herself
that she could not help but be happy in her heart.</p>

<p>But she heard, in the long darkness of the hall, sighs and
groans, and the sounds of some girls weeping softly into their
pillows, fretting away with homesickness and heartweariness, and
Agnes rose up and went to the sides of their cots one after
another and asked them,</p>

<p>‘What is it now that’s troubling your dreams, dear
one?’</p>

<p>And one after another they were answering her, saying,
‘It’s hard the work is here, and I miss my ma and my da and
my brothers at home.’</p>

<p>‘Come with me, and I’ll smooth away your trouble,’
Agnes told the girls.</p>

<p>She led them to her own cot by the doorway, where they all
clustered round. And Agnes pulled out a dog-eared book, and it
was so well-used the whole of its spine was worn away, and the
girls might read no title there. And putting the book open, and
singing down a witch-light and rubbing the last glow out of its
scales, Agnes starting reading the tale of Prince Og and
Princess Maeve, which in the course of its course runs much as
follows:</p>

<p><i>Out of all the gentle places remaining in the Innis
Fodhla</i>, Agnes read, the two strongest were those of the moon
and of the woods. But the gentle place of the moon was
better-peopled and defended: it was the last true stronghold of
gentleness left in the isle. As for the Princess of the woods,
Princess Mab, she was hunted by men and Englishmen, and saw her
hills built upon with castles of conceit, and her woods cut low,
or tamed into parks for hunting, until in the end she was left
with only a few sides of hills scattered widely, and a few
tangled shadowy corners of woods, as the last shrunken yards of
what was once an empire.</p>

<p>The last of her folk clung to her, but they too dwindled,
hunted by the Englishmen, until in the end only one hart and one
hind were left to her. And then a hunting party found them out,
and cut off the hind’s head and shouldered her flanks home to
their cooking pots.</p>

<p>Now nine days after this, the Man of the Bog happened to be
in that place, setting his traps and lairs. It wasn’t after
foxes and badgers the Man of the Bog was hunting, but after this
and that: strange curious things: a bit of moonshine, a patch of
mist, a cobweb, a will o’ the wisp. The Man of the Bog was
checking his traps and his lures, when he heard a sobbing in the
wind: went over the hillside and found the Princess Mab weeping
over her last fallen faithful one, but she was bright as a
mirror for all her sadness, and the Man of the Bog in an instant
was falling in love of her. ‘Come away into my arms,’ he was
saying, ‘my bright Princess Mab, and I’ll be making you
forget all your causes for bitterness and pain.’ And she,
being gentle and a princess, longed for his kisses, and went
weeping to his arms.</p>

<p>And for a time they abided in the wild moors and the Bog,
where only the wayward go, and are soon trapped and lost for
ever. And all that time they were as happy as any of their kind
could be with the counties overrun with Englishmen and
Protestants.</p>

<p>The daughter of this pair was the Princess Maeve, and she was
born in the same moonlight as saw the birth of Prince Og. All
throughout the gentle places the birth of the Moon Princess’
son was proclaimed, and in a few dank places under leaves folk
talked of the birth of Princess Maeve as well.</p>

<p>Then and there the Man of the Bog and Princess Mab decided
they would wed their daughter to the son of the Moon Princess,
the way her mother was a Princess without a county, and her
daughter would be a Princess in nothing but her name. And this,
they reckoned, was to be the last Great Hope of the gentle folk,
that the uniting of the Moon and the Hill should make a place
and a county strong enough to withstand the assaults of the
World. Even the Moon Princess placed the kiss of her lips on
this agreement, and nothing in all the gentle places was looked
for with such eagerness as this uniting, and the offspring of
the union, though the promised spouses were still no more than
twinklings in their leafy cribs, and each had yet to endure its
fostering abroad in the arms and houses and homes of men.</p>

<p>Into the world and homes of men went Prince Og, but it was
into the world and lairs of the beasts that Princess Maeve was
meant to go, and for seven years she was brought up as a beast
of the field and the woods. But it was only the curse of the
Moon Princess awaiting Princess Maeve when those seven years of
the World had passed.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Agnes, closing up her book, and kissing its
spine, ‘are you thinking your lot is so bad, and your service
here an exile, an ionarbadh? Then think on poor Princess Maeve,
and count yourselves lucky at that.’</p>

<p>So she was sending them back to their cots, with dry eyes and
soothed hearts. Then all at once Agnes looked up, the way the
witchlight had swum away, and a long, thin shadow was falling
out of the mist across the low eye-shaped window of the low,
long hall. The shadow stirred, and moved away. Into the darkness
Agnes went, but only nine dim witch-lights were swimming there,
and no one else.</p>

<p>‘Who were you, now?’ Agnes murmured. She looked up at the
ruined bell-tower dark in the mist. But then the weariness of
her work was weighing on her, and she went back to her lonely
cot inside the doorway.</p>

<p class="break">THAT DARKNESS was a long one. And Agnes dreamed
the old servant of her lord, Mac Bride, came and stood over her
cot. He held a witchlight by the tail.</p>

<p>‘Come with me, Miss,’ he was telling her, ‘and I’ll
do you a service.’</p>

<p>She smiled at him in her dream, and went out of the hall,
across the lawn, to the gleaming abbey. Mac Bride led her up the
steps and in by way of the open gates.</p>

<p>‘Turn now,’ he told her, ‘look to the lough.’</p>

<p>It was late in the darkness. At the water’s edge the Swan
Boat was bumping up to the mooring pole, and nine men and women
in wild attire were leaping up aland.</p>

<p>Mac Bride in her dream said, ‘These are the lady’s
robbers back from their kailees. They are the first back this
darkness. Look to their boots, now!’</p>

<p>And she saw their boots blackened with mire.</p>

<p>Then she might hold her peace no more, but in her dream
addressed them.</p>

<p>‘Gentle sirs and ladies,’ she said, ‘I know you are
wearied from your hunts, and that your joints must be chill from
the damp. Your one desire is to return to the fire-warmed rooms,
array yourselves, kiss your sweethearts and attend your lady.</p>

<p>‘But think first of what you do here, when you return with
boots and shoes full of the black mud of the bogs. See your
trail up the outer steps; look on the steps you mean to mount!
They are black, but the foremost ones are white, and clean. It
was myself cleaned them, and it was all I could do, during the
hours you were abed, to scrape the mud from six of them, and
make a start at the seventh. Six, of a hundred and one!</p>

<p>‘If you go on as you are, then these six by next moonrise
will be blacker than the other ninety and five. Have pity on me,
I beg you, for my heart is breaking from the uselessness of all
I do, that is as quickly undone, by you. My years will go for
nothing, and I will die here as I started. As if I had not lived
at all. Do not rob me of my life, do not murder me, but take
care, I implore you, and tread lightly on my dreams.’</p>

<p>Those words were among the hardest she had ever uttered, even
in a dream; there were tears in her eyes and her voice was near
breaking under the weight of them.</p>

<p>And the riotous bandits praised the scrub woman, the way she
was as desperate as themselves. Out through the doors they went,
and washed off their boots in the lough.</p>

<p>By then was another Swan Boat returning, and another load of
robbers approaching the abbey. Agnes must repeat her words,
fully thirteen times, all the long darkness, until her voice was
cracking and her eyes red with tears, and she was tossing about
in her cot. In the long low hall the other serving girls
gathered round her, touching her shoulder and speaking her name,
softly, softly, ‘Agnes! Agnes!’ Until at last she
answered.</p>

<p class="break">AFTER THEIR MEAL, the girls went to their
appointed tasks. Agnes took her brushes and pail and went into
the abbey by the side door, the way the crescent gates were
shut, and all the robbers dreaming and touching their lovers
high above her.</p>

<p>Agnes bent over the first step. And she saw to her surprise
that it was not black but white, white as the pelt of the White
Hind, and shone in the moonglow like a mirror.</p>

<p>And after that darkness the trollops and bandits never failed
of washing their boots in the lough, and struck off the clods of
mud staining their breeches and hems before they came into the
abbey. Indeed, so clean were their feet from then on, that they
tended rather to take old dirt up, and left the stairs cleaner
for their passing, the way it was their great delight to outdo
themselves incessantly. Each moon now Agnes cleaned seven steps
more; on the next moon when she came, she saw those seven were
cleaner than she’d left them. And in less than thirteen moons,
all the Hundred Steps and a Step were sparkling; and they never
needed cleaning, ever again.</p>

<p class="break">IT WAS PROCLAIMED that there would be held a
masquerade on Samhain, on the long dark of the moon: and all
diversions would be enjoyed at that ball, and a special
exhibition of the dancers. At that ball Arianna would make her
choice, who would be her next champion.</p>

<p>The time of the masquerade came nearer, and all the dancers
fearing it. But Mielusine now, she was quiet all the time, and a
bit sad, the way she never danced now so well as she had that
once, when only one pair of eyes could see. In all the time
since, Mielusine hadn’t once heard any word from Vasquez. And
still and all she told Ino to be paying Vasquez’ debts.</p>

<p>The dwarf squawked, but ‘Haven’t I money enough for it,
now?’ said she. ‘Then do as I bid you, Banker Ino.’</p>

<p>What now was comforting her, was a strange thing: it was the
small white stone she’d stolen from Master Aengus’ room.
Mielusine kept the leag lorgmhar on the table by her bed, and
touched it to her lips before she rested. The leag lorgmhar
guarded her dreams. She was glad she hadn’t returned it, the
way it now was hers.</p>

<p>Now after kissing the stone the dancer had a dream, and this
was the way of it.</p>

<p>Atop the bell-tower, the door to Master Aengus’ rooms was
open; in front of the bells a man was standing, and he reaching
for her, saying, ‘Come.’ And the voice of the man in the
dream was Vasquez’ voice.</p>

<p>The dream left her, and Mielusine rose up out of bed.
Moonbeams were pouring into her window, swirling with the mist.
Mielusine stepped into the light, turning slowly, silently
watching her limbs making whirlpools in the mist. The power of
the dance was entering into her, the way she was yielding to it,
moving beautifully as some wild thing footing the strait paths
of a hill. In a way she was leaving herself behind; she was the
dance she made.</p>

<p>Drawing her velvet cloak over her shift, bare footed, shaking
her black ringlets, Mielusine went out of her room. The lawns of
the crannog were powdery with snow, cold and clean on her toes.
The broken steps and ladders were patchwork in the moonbeams
falling through chinks in the wall. The door, it was not open as
in her dream; but easily it yielded to her small hand, and in
she danced, silent as a moonbeam.</p>

<p>He was there awaiting her. She knew he would be.</p>

<p>But who was he?</p>

<p>He was sitting by the bell beneath the telescope. His arms
were braced against the window frame, and his legs dangling out
over the ledge, and himself leaning far into the night. Beyond
him the sky was ablaze with stars, shining on the surface of
mist, bright like the sea.</p>

<p>It was long since the Maid had looked upon the stars in their
nakedness. The sight swam in her like porter; her breath was
sweetened even more by the thought of the dark man aloft.</p>

<p>He hadn’t seen her yet. Mielusine felt no fear of him.
Still dancing, she glided to him and said,</p>

<p>‘Faith, what is it you’re looking for?’</p>

<p>The figure looked back. Mielusine saw the outline of his face
against the stars; it seemed he was staring at her. Then he
twisted his body and swung his legs back in, leaning weakly
against the window frame.</p>

<p>‘For the cowardice to jump,’ he answered her. He did not
speak in Vasquez’ voice; it was another’s voice – one she
knew. ‘But I’ll never be finding it, the way I know she is
still out there, somewhere hidden in the white. Who’re
you?’</p>

<p>‘I am Mielusine. Weren’t you waiting for me? Now I am
come. Teach me, please.’</p>

<p>He stood, none too surely, and stepped into the room. For a
moment she was losing sight of him; then a light flared up from
a bit of straw in the embers; he was lighting the candles on the
table.</p>

<p>In the light his face seemed less drawn and tormented than
she remembered. She did not wonder to see again the face that
once she had seen buried under an apple tree. Curiously she
looked on the bandages wrapping his breast: once white, now
dirtied with dark, old blood.</p>

<p>‘Come on then,’ he told her. ‘Didn’t she send you for
this? Do you know what you’re wanting from me, or are you only
coming for a look?’</p>

<p>He was bending over the table, and not looking at her at all.
There was a hanging gathered by the table, and Mielusine danced
in close to it.</p>

<p>‘Stand there!’ he commanded. ‘’Tis better so, your
face in shadow. They’ll be telling a more honest fable. I see
you are young, and pretty enough – but you were not always
pretty, nor were you powerful in Day.’</p>

<p>Mielusine saw in his hands a stack of beautiful cards, and he
drawing them together and apart with his long, strong
fingers.</p>

<p>‘What are you about?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Didn’t she tell you a thing about me?’</p>

<p>Mielusine, her face still in shadow, smiled. He sighed.
‘Arianna should say a thing before she sends her wards to
me.’ He thrust the cards across the table.</p>

<p>‘Draw them into three stacks.’ So she did.</p>

<p>He began laying the cards out across the table. Mielusine had
seen cards at fairs, but never any so large or beautiful, or
with those strange names. And now he was telling her about
herself as though he’d known her all his life. Mielusine was
enchanted. How could he know such things?</p>

<p>‘And that is all I have to be telling you.’</p>

<p>Over their heads on the rooftop, the dark man sat in
tailor-fashion within the tent of his dark gray cóta mór, and
he was hearkening to their words, and hearing them all quite
clearly. But still he only listened, and did not move, not yet.
Only now, he grinned. Skulls grin as broadly as the dark man
grinned.</p>

<p>The Bacach leaned back, and a bit of pain caressed his face,
and Mielusine saw how weary he was with no resting, the way he
was spending all his hours here thinking of his love until it
was a poison in him, and searching for her in the water and in
the mist, and everywhere else she wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mielusine felt bewildered. Was this the secret of love?</p>

<p>‘What card is that?’ she asked. To one side lay one card
face down.</p>

<p>‘’Tis the final card,’ he answered. ‘The card of the
querent – of the seeker. ’Tis your card. Turn it up if you
like: it is not for me to do.’</p>

<p>Mielusine reached out for it, feeling its riddle calling to
her. He added while she was reaching, ‘You needn’t show it
to me or even be telling me what it is. It’s only to you that
card need be speaking.’</p>

<p>She took it between her fingers. On the card was painted a
beautiful woman pouring water from two ewers. Mielusine laid the
card on the table.</p>

<p>‘Le Stelle,’ she murmured, reading what was written
across the bottom of the card. ‘What does it mean?’</p>

<p>He looked at her searchingly, the way she was glad for the
hanging and its shadow.</p>

<p>‘The word, d’you mean, or the card?’</p>

<p>‘The word.’</p>

<p>‘The word means, “the Stars.”&nbsp;’</p>

<p>‘’Tis a pretty card.’ She wasn’t even blushing a bit,
though the lady on the card was naked as a tree in winter.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t there to be pretty,’ he said. He was angry
now, raking the cards into a heap. ‘Learn from it. Now let you
be going. If Arianna wasn’t sending you here you shouldn’t
have been coming. Be going now!’</p>

<p>She glided back before his vehemence. He was rising, but
already Mielusine was passing out of his rooms in silent wonder,
leaving him and his pain behind her like a bad dream.</p>

<p>Round and round and down the steps she spiraled. Gladness was
in her heart. She felt the moonlight burning her breasts. In the
empty dancing hall she cast down her cloak and kicked off even
her shift, and was dancing round in the dark, naked as a tree in
winter, naked and free, and whirling ever faster before the
small white stone.</p>

<p>The way she was finding the joy of the dance again, and
making its mystery her own.</p>

<p class="break">ONE SPOT ONLY on all the Hundred Steps and a
Step remained dark, a spider-shaped stain near the topmost
riser, nine steps from Arianna’s door. Agnes was cleaning it
almost with love, the way it was the end of her labors. So full
of her task was she, she did not even notice the step falling
behind her, nor the soft rustle of the lady’s skirts.</p>

<p>As to the Maid Buan now, whose skirts and step they were, she
was looking on the serving woman with wonder. Sure now, she
thought, there are marvels in the Night! That this creature
could have made shine the Hundred Steps and a Step!</p>

<p>‘And it was a clever seamstress I heard you were,’
exclaimed Maid Buan, ‘but these steps are so bright, ’tis a
far better charwoman you must be.’</p>

<p>The serving-girl looked up at the maid from beneath a mop of
tangled, greasy hair. ‘I thank you for it,’ she answered,
‘but I cannot say, from all I’ve heard, that you make that
good a lady.’</p>

<p>Maid Buan laughed. ‘But you’re the rare insolent one!
’Twould almost seem you’ve a lover here of some repute, that
you’d dare say such words to me! Are you not Agnes? Maid
Mielusine tells me it was you who made her fine white gown, and
is it the very truth?’</p>

<p>The serving-girl nodded.</p>

<p>‘Serve as my seamstress, then, and make me a gown for the
lady’s masquerade. It’s rich your reward will be if you
please me. All tools and materials I’ll furnish, and you may
be staying in my rooms with my servants if you please.’</p>

<p>In the serving-girl’s wild eyes, green as leaves in a windy
wood, something was dawning, and she looking far beyond the
maid. For a moment Maid Buan thought the woman must be simple;
that she might even be so peculiar as to refuse her; but at
length Agnes pursed her lips and bowed her head and answered,</p>

<p>‘It’s sorry I am, Maid Buan, for the sharpness of my
tongue. To be your seamstress would be my honor.’ She looked
up sharp into Buan’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘I will make you a gown.’</p>

<p>Maid Buan was surprised that so simple a saying could mean so
much to her: all at once a vision entered her head, of herself
at the masquerade, the lodestone of the bandits’ eyes.</p>

<p>‘’Tis well,’ she said. ‘I have the stuff already, it
is samite, sendaline, cloth of gold—’</p>

<p>But the strange serving-girl was shaking her head, telling
her solemnly, ‘I will make you a black dress.’</p>

<p class="break">FITTING-FORMS, silver pins and needles, spools
of thread, bolts of silks and satins, bows, ribbons, fine
linens: beautiful things, and the sight of them, so long
forgotten, made Agatha’s eyes smart.</p>

<p>Come moonrise she set to work, and while the Maid and her
servants were dreaming beneath their lovers’ touch, Agnes spun
and sewed and snipped by the light of the Moon.</p>

<p>And she sang as she cut, and she hummed as she sewed, only
she made no sound singing, the way all the melodies were only in
the gown. She made her a black gown, and freed herself, in that
dress, of the steps, of the snow, and of the Hind: of moonglow
and starlight and all things white like bones, like grins, like
innocence.</p>

<p>It was the last bolt of cloth that Master Aengus made, his
nine moons’ work, that Agnes made into that gown.</p>

<p>Now, come moonrise the serving-girl dressed Maid Buan for
retiring, and then the maid dismissed her. It was even then that
Agnes would be entering the maid’s chambers to take up again
her work.</p>

<p>Then Agnes saw how Maid Buan undraped the black velvet
hangings from a certain glass on the wall and looked deeply into
it. Her face burned redly, then paled, and her eyes were
distraught; Maid Buan sighed, shook her head, and returned the
hanging to cover the mirror. Sadly she went into her bedchamber,
alone, and Agnes felt a tug of sorrow for her, though she
didn’t know why. Each moonrise Agnes watched Maid Buan perform
the same ceremony before she went into her bedchamber, alone.
Then Agnes looked long on the black hangings, before she sat
herself down and took up her needles and thread.</p>

<p class="break">IT HAD BEEN the fashion for gowns to be
elaborate, with embroidery, lace and needlework, and layer upon
layer of linens; and Agnes knew that such would be the very
taste of Maid Buan. But in the black gown Agnes eschewed all
ornament, and cut simply, so that its lines should not be in any
way obscured.</p>

<p>And on the skirt of the gown she wove tiny brilliants in
patterns of the stars zodiacal, the way that light played upon
it, shimmering, winking. But the narrow bodice of the gown she
left bare of brilliants. The way the gown was blackest round
where the back and bosom would show, cloudlike and celestial.
Only upon the left bosom of the bodice, Agnes was wanting to
place one jewel. But there was nothing in Maid Buan’s
jewelry-case she was liking; so she left it bare.</p>

<p>And the skirt, all scattered with brilliants, was soft, and
wide like a country girl’s attire.</p>

<p>Along with the gown Agnes was making two shoes, tiny things
of black with silver buckles set with three brilliants. She did
not know just the shape of Maid Buan’s feet, the way she was
making the shoes to fit her own. And she made a clip for the
hair with the last three brilliants in the jewelry case. And she
made a black mask as well, for half the face; and she cut eyes
out of the mask, and they long and narrow.</p>

<p class="break">WHEN THE GOWN was done and the shoes set beside
it, then Agnes looked on it and falling in love with her work
said,</p>

<p>‘No one will wear this gown but myself.’</p>

<p>Then there were only three moons left before the masquerade.
For two moons Agnes fitted the gown to herself. And on the last
moon of all she caught up what fabrics came first to hand, the
samite, the sendaline, the cloth of gold, and with handfuls of
lace, ribbons and ruffles, she stitched together another gown
for Maid Buan. The maid was quite pleased with it, and it was
quite good enough for her, too.</p>

<p>And when that second gown was finished, Agnes looked again on
the black velvet hangings that covered Maid Buan’s mirror on
the wall. And she stepped over to them and lifted them,
uncovering the rich, strange carvings of the frame; and she
looked deeply into the image in the dim, silvery glass.</p>

<p>With the rising of the final Moon before Samhain, Agnes went
down to the long low hall and laid herself down to rest. Weary
as she was, she was yet a-tremble, for the pleasure of the
thought of the beautiful black gown. And then fear began to grow
in her, and doubt. Sure now, someone would know her as the woman
who washed the steps; the bandits would cast her out from the
ball before a general mockery.</p>

<p>She paced the hall, and stepped up to the window. The moon
was sinking through the grass. And at last the girl did manage,
uneasily, to rest: then her resting sat on her like a stone, and
she couldn’t get up.</p>

<p>And the Moon sank, and once more the stars wheeled round to
touch the Samhain mark, when all souls and dreams are loosed.
And for four and twenty hours the Moon did not rise nor
shine.</p>

<p>And the masquerade began, and Agnes slept on.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22">22. Of the Masquerade</a></h2>

<p class="first">DURING THE LAST MOONS before the masquerade,
Lady Arianna was closed up in her garden, alone. Never a soul
saw her in that time; but sometimes lovers strolling beneath the
garden wall heard a soft low humming there.</p>

<p>And in that time, on the streets of the village across the
lough, the countryfolk were shaking their heads. And their young
daughters went down to the lough fifty at a time, ringing the
bell and calling to the ferrymen, ‘Take me across, now! Let me
go into service in the abbey!’ ‘No, take me instead, I’m
more clever and willing!’</p>

<p>And in the long low hall the serving girls were hugging and
kissing one another, the way they knew their service was
reaching an end, and soon they would be rewarded and sent home
again. The thought of their old parents was making them smile a
sly and wicked smile. They were no more the sweet obedient
lasses they’d been when they had come.</p>

<p>‘It is not the same for me,’ Agnes told them. ‘I’ll
be taking no duais, let the steps be as bright as they can
be.’</p>

<p>Agnes had dwelt on the crannog in the mist then almost the
full term of service. Nine Moons had risen in the time since she
had come across on the Swan Boat. And more, the Hundred Steps
and a Step were clean, and many a time Old Meg came calling for
Agnes, to be sending her on her way. But Agnes kept away from
her, and could flee when she wished into Maid Buan’s chambers,
where Old Meg dared not set foot.</p>

<p>In the bell-tower on the moon before the lady’s masquerade
there was darkness and quiet, save for the soft hiss of the
embers, and the passing of moonbeams through the window.</p>

<p>In that window the man was sitting, one leg dangling in the
room, the other bent on the sill. He was dressed plain and dark,
the way free-holding farmers might have gone to church in Day.
His hair was dark and unruly, with a streak of silver above the
left temple; his face was troubled. In his lap was curled his
long-haired white cat. Her chin was resting on his hand. On the
windowsill beside the man’s foot lay a card, face down.</p>

<p>The shining mist washing and lapping at the wall beneath the
window made no sound. Far away stretched that waterish silence
underneath the moon. Clouds came, covering the moon, the way the
darkness deepened, and the room was lost to sight.</p>

<p>There was a war being waged in the soul of the Bacach. The
different and various selves of him were fighting one against
the others.</p>

<p>On top of them all sat the Wounded Lover, who loved the White
Hind. But she was slain. Who had slain the White Hind? A
vagabond man, a dark soul, a hideous rascal. And he grieved and
would have wept the clock round, for the loss of his White
Hind.</p>

<p>But under that self there lurked the Avenger. He hated the
killer of the White Hind, and he cursed that killer, and damned
him for all eternity.</p>

<p>But close under the side of the Avenger there hid the
Observer. He knew some part of the truth, though he was mute and
might not speak. But the Observer felt a chill steel scian blade
piercing his heart when he heard the curses of the Avenger.</p>

<p>Then there was the Sly self, that laughed at himself and all
the other selves for their pains and their furies and fears.</p>

<p>There was over the Sly self the Philosopher, that cared
nothing for any of them, and set their pains at nought. He it
was looked into the stars, and reckoned their movements, and had
no care for anything under Heaven.</p>

<p>And there was the Madman, and this was the the self that the
Bacach feared most of all. Round and round the Madman turned,
and with a cutting blade he slashed at himself, and raged and
bit.</p>

<p>And last and least of them all, there was a nameless self,
that had the secret and the answer to all the pains and fears
and anger of the other selves. But this one lived in terror of
some great shadowy Thing that never showed its face. It was not
mute, the nameless self, but it hid deep away in the folds and
the corners, and never came out.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Bacach remembered, but memories were too much
to bear, and sank back into the stuff of dreams. Sometimes the
Bacach wished, but his wishes too were painful, and worse they
went beyond his grasp, and he turned his back on them.</p>

<p>‘Bacach!’ sounded a soft voice from where the moonbeams
had fallen. For the moon over the county of mists had set;
darkness blacked the sky; blackness filled the bell-tower. </p>

<p>‘Who is calling me,’ asked the man, turning his head.</p>

<p>‘Do you not know me, my Bacach? Shame be to you for
that!’</p>

<p>There’d been no sound or any light from the steps; and
surely the man would have noted any such thing in the black,
silent tower.</p>

<p>Over their heads, on the roof of the bell-tower, the dark man
in his dark gray cóta mór leaned closer over his knees. His
eyes narrowed into slits, and he was listening now with a heart
and a half.</p>

<p>‘My heart is restless, my Bacach. I’m going to the garden
gate time and again. Not even darkness soothes me. I’m finding
no pleasure in my food or drink, my blood hounds or my
blossoms.’</p>

<p>‘You are bored,’ he answered.</p>

<p>‘What then will revive my interest?’</p>

<p>‘Your new champion will do that.’</p>

<p>‘Who will he be, Bacach? What man would you choose for
me?’</p>

<p>‘One you do not know, with a mind of his own.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Bacach, how I treasure you!’</p>

<p>‘Then let me go!’ he cried; and the vehemence of his pain
left a trembling in its wake.</p>

<p>The dark man on the rooftop reached forth, and gripped the
edge of the parapet in his long lean fingers, and drew himself
that closer to the edge.</p>

<p>‘Where would you be going?’ she asked, in an injured
voice.</p>

<p>He gestured. There was a glow, half as of phosphorous, in the
darkness where his fingers traced.</p>

<p>‘There’s only death waiting out there for you, Bacach,’
the voice reminded him.</p>

<p>‘One time I’ll leave,’ he promised her. ‘I’ll swim
away in this lake. I’m only waiting, the way I don’t know
where else to find her.’</p>

<p>‘What a stubborn child you are! Don’t be thinking to
match your magic against mine! Twice now I’ve conjured you
back out of death, and now you belong to me three times over,
body and soul, and it’s here with me I want you.’</p>

<p>He drew his fingers over his brow, like a sign. ‘Tell me
what I was before. Was my name Master Aengus?’</p>

<p>‘Who’s been whispering that name to you?’ she hissed.
‘I forbid it!’</p>

<p>The cat mewed, and she jumped to the floor with a soft
thump-bump of paws.</p>

<p>Now the lady’s voice purred more soothingly, closer to the
man’s ear, though still there was no sight of her in the dark
beyond the bells.</p>

<p>‘Draw the cards for me, Bacach,’ she said. ‘Tell me of
my lover.’</p>

<p>In the dark he lighted a candle and laid the cards, and
answered all her questions. But his mind must have been
elsewhere that time, the way, when time came to turn the card of
the querent, it was two cards he’d laid down there by
accident. One was La Torre, and the other La Temperanz. And when
those cards were upturned, the unseen visitor’s laughter rang
off the old bells.</p>

<p>‘O Bacach, I had a dream this moon. Untie its riddle for
me. This is the way of it. I was on top of the casino, walking
back and forth, waiting for someone. The night was frosty, and
the stars so bright that I could reach my hand out and almost
pluck them from the sky.</p>

<p>‘Then the stars dimmed, and I saw through the mist all my
Swan boats burning on the lough. The fires went onto the land
and were eating up all the trees of my orchards over the hills
as far as the eye could see, making such a heat that the mists
of this county were dispelled, leaving us naked under Heaven.</p>

<p>‘I called below, three times: at the third call there was a
stirring, and my wards roused the bandits, and they rushed to
save my orchards. There was still one ferry boat unburning, tied
to the mooring pole.</p>

<p>‘But there was unseen to all of us a little red-brown
mouse, and she chewing the rope of the ferry, sharpening her
little white teeth. The last Swan Boat swung away, and my
bandits fell stumbling into the water, drowning.’</p>

<p>The dark man on the rooftop drew on his strong long fingers,
and pulled himself up standing.</p>

<p>‘What else betid?’ asked the Bacach.</p>

<p>‘Only the heat of the fires and the furious golden light
surrounding me, and I woke.’</p>

<p>The man turned back into the window, dropping both legs into
the lapping mist. He tugged on the white lock of his hair, and
the dark man overhead could see him quite clearly now in the
candle-glow.</p>

<p>‘It’s a hard dream,’ he said carefully. ‘I must
ponder it.’</p>

<p>‘Do that,’ said the lady’s voice. ‘And now I mind me
of it, you too were in the dream, O Bacach, standing on a rock,
watching the little brown mouse. You knew how her labors would
end, and yet you said nothing at all.’</p>

<p>Her voice sighed away into the silence of the lapping mist,
yet a certain peril hung still in the air. Overhead the clouds
moved on, baring the breast of the moon again. The Bacach picked
up the cards beside him on the sill, and stepped down into the
room, hiding from the stars. He lighted the twisted, bubbled end
of another candle on the table, and shuffled and dealt out the
cards.</p>

<p>‘I will test your fortunes, brown mouse.’ That drawing
was unclear; but the card of the querent showed a winged
trumpeter summoning forth a man and two women naked from the
ground. And the name on that card was Il Giudizio.</p>

<p>‘Once more, once more,’ he was whispering: ‘and how
many times is that? I’ll draw out her portrait once more, to
see if I may find her.’ And for the hundredth time or more he
was laying the cards for the White Hind.</p>

<p>The reading he was getting, it was confusion and
obscurity.</p>

<p>At last he came to the down-turned card of the querent, of
the White Hind. He was staring on that card for the longest
time. Then carelessly he flipped it over. It was the same, of
course. That card was always the same for her.</p>

<p>A hundred times or more he had drawn for her, always that one
same card. And sitting staring at it, he was wishing he hadn’t
dismissed the girl in the shift and velvet cloak, or at least
that he could be remembering the name she’d given him.</p>

<p>The card of the White Hind was the card of a beautiful woman
kneeling beside a pool, pouring water from two ewers, and the
sky over her head ablaze with lights. And she naked as a tree in
winter, and under her the words, Le Stelle.</p>

<p>The man stood, gathered the cards carefully in his hands, and
put them into his pocket.</p>

<p>And the stillness about the abbey was broken by strains of
music through the walls, the way the moon was sunk, and the
darkness rising, and Arianna’s masquerade beginning.</p>

<p>For a time the Bacach was listening to the distant airs.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said: ‘I will go to this ball. She is
there.’</p>

<p>So he straightened his coat, drew his fingers through his
hair, and for the first time in the nine Moons since his burial,
the Bacach left the bell-tower. </p>

<p>And the dark man in the dark gray cóta mór crept down the
wall to the window to the bell-tower room, and swung lightly in.
A time he tarried, shuffling through the Bacach’s papers and
going through his things; then he went off through the door,
after the Bacach.</p>

<p>In the dancing hall Mac Bride had left a thousand candles
burning, and schools of the fishy witchlights swam about the
rafters, and folk were entering wigged and masked. This was
Arianna’s masquerade, when she would choose her champion; and
all the gentlefolk of the Night were gathering to honor her, and
vie for the honor of being chosen.</p>

<p>The doors of the dancing hall were open onto lighted lawns
where a thousand couples were strolling and casting coins into
the lough. The silver coins were flashing and sinking in the
inky waters, spilling round the sleeping damsel curled upon her
side on the lakebed, while the currents tousled the ringlets of
her hair.</p>

<p>And in the witchlights all the ladies were graceful and all
the gentlemen elegant. There was a glamour cast over them all
that darkness by Arianna, the way that all their flaws were
hidden, and all their beauties shone. It was no hard task to
tell the men apart despite their masks, but the ladies were
transfigured into enigmas, and that was the lady’s desire.</p>

<p>Now, all the bandits were bursting to discover which of the
ladies was Arianna, the way they would be devoting their
attentions to her, to be chosen her champion. There was even a
deal of wagering as to which lady was Arianna, and which bandit
should be the first to unmask her. Some were saying that she had
not yet arrived, others that she would not come at all, but only
watched them from a secret recess. And still others were
claiming she would come and go many times, in many masks.</p>

<p>Many gamblers wagered on a lady all in gold, and her hair
dusted gold over its native darkness. She had the grace of a
Tinker, her smile was smooth as a liar’s tongue, and upon her
breast she wore a pin in the shape of an L.</p>

<p>But others put their money on a lady dressed in scarlet, the
very hue of fresh-spilt blood. Her bared, slender shoulders were
a provocation, her laughter lazy and insolent, and her mask it
was the mask of a fox. She was the center round which many
orbited, including Banker Ino, who was held to be wittier than
the bandits, and privy to the lady’s secrets.</p>

<p>And many put their chances on another lady all in gold; and
Maid Buan was delighted with the acclaim her gown was gathering
her, and she danced every dance with a different rogue. But at
the end of the masquerade Maid Buan still went back to her
chambers alone, though even she herself couldn’t have told you
why.</p>

<p>But most chose out a lady in white as Arianna: and she was
Mielusine.</p>

<p>She wore her white gown, and the mask of the White Hind. And
beholding herself in the glass, a fan in her hand, her bosom
bared, her hair powdered and set, the enchanted mask upon her
with its braided tail curving round her throat, Mielusine had
had to reach out and touch the glass to be sure it was herself,
indeed.</p>

<p>And in stepping down the stair, something had come over her,
some shadow of a dream. She moved with sureness and was unknown
by even her teachers, the way she was become the promise
unfulfillable, the mystery, and the veil.</p>

<p>Dance after dance she moved about the floor, and she drank
wine and breathed in the odor of the lough without, until she
was so happy, that she felt herself twinned, and beheld herself
beneath herself, laughing and floating and herself sweetly
drunken upon flattery and the clamor of all men’s desire.</p>

<p>She saw Vasquez dancing with two ladies at once; he was
easily known, the way he wore his bodach mask.</p>

<p>‘For shame,’ called Mielusine upon his head, ‘and what
would your dancing friend say if she saw you so?’</p>

<p>From her words he knew her, but was not at all abashed.</p>

<p>‘My patroness must surely know,’ he said, ‘that even as
I gained from her what I most desired, so she won from me what
herself most longed for.’</p>

<p>Mielusine considered the matter, sheltered by her fan, then
laughed. ‘You do not deceive yourself, Sir. But for this at
least you must bear shame, that you appear unmasked at
Arianna’s masquerade.’</p>

<p>The two ladies bursting into laughter of the most wicked
tones, and Vasquez for once in his life discomfited, not knowing
how to respond: wasn’t that the most delicious moment for
Mielusine in all that darkness?</p>

<p>She moved on with a flourish into the whirling dancers and
took command of the floor, the way all were applauding her, and
their glad cries echoed by the screaming of a hawk flown into
the hall. Three times the hawk screamed, stopping all chatter,
stopping all dancing.</p>

<p>It was the cry of that bird, woke Agnes at last.</p>

<p>She sat straight up in her cot and rubbed the dreams from her
eyes. Through the low eye-shaped window light was streaming.
There was a great brightness from witchlights swimming about the
grounds.</p>

<p>It was the masquerade. And how many hours since it had
begun?</p>

<p>She thought to herself, <i>It was fated; I am too late; I
cannot go now.</i></p>

<p>Then she was gathering up the gown and leaving the hall. She
passed to the snowy rocks beyond Arianna’s garden. There she
set down her bundles, and drew off her shift.</p>

<p>The night was cold, and the black water colder still. She bit
her lip and stepped in until she was quite swallowed up.</p>

<p>Bathing below the surface, sinking, she looked back up toward
the night. The abbey shone there, fiery and swirling like a
weeping of suns; Agnes swam up into its fire, drawing in a great
breath.</p>

<p>Now, three of Arianna’s most feared bandits were strolling
nearby, smoking and arguing which lady was Arianna’s mask.
Then Ali put up his arm and said,</p>

<p>‘Behold the Lady of the Lough.’</p>

<p>Emerging from the water with a reed in her hand was a
lake-wet, red naked girl. With grace and ease she dried herself
from her bath. She set her hair up, and only then began to cover
the perfection of her shape. At first it seemed a pity to the
bandits, that such beauty must be disfigured by clothing; but
when they saw the black gown on her like a second skin, then
they saw that beauty embellished a hundredfold.</p>

<p>‘Surely, this is some goddess born out of the lough,’
murmured Sir Stephen.</p>

<p>‘She has not been at the masquerade, else I should have
remarked her,’ vowed Phillippe. ‘Ali, in truth, this is our
lady, or else her double on earth. Now, let us three keep this
secret, and let no one else hear of it: so we may reduce the
number of our rivals.’ The robbers agreed, and stole back into
the hall.</p>

<p>Over the doors of the casino, an emerald was hanging on a
spider’s thread. A sign of bronze reflected it, graven with
these words:</p>

<p class="center"><i>For the Fairest</i></p>

<p>All the ladies had reached for that jewel, but it had crawled
up the spider thread out of their reach, leaving them laughing,
somewhat scornfully, and cursing the dwarf, the way it was sure
to be his work.</p>

<p>Agnes saw the jewel, but never the sign. It was the same
emerald the village girl had taken for her place on the Swan
Boat, and it was the same emerald the old lord had given Lady
Agatha long, long before, when the Sun still shone.</p>

<p>She reached up and took it into her palm. She fastened it to
the left breast of her gown where it belonged. Only then did she
see the sign.</p>

<p><i>This cannot be</i>, she said in herself, <i>I cannot be
the fairest, with this black spot on my palm</i>. But the spot
was gone, and her hand pale and pink as a girl’s. And she
could not have said when she had last seen the spot.</p>

<p>As soon as Agnes entered the hall, bandits and self-made
princes drew to her. She was the lady herself: they were sure of
it! Setting her black skirts swirling, showing her ankles and
even a bit of her calf, Agnes lost the last bit of her
reserve.</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ she answered to all and no one there, ‘and I
am the Spirit of the Dark of the Moon.’</p>

<p>But the other ladies were crying at the blue-green hawk
flying about the candles. And they complaining to the bandits,
‘Will none of you rid us of this bird?’</p>

<p>The bandits set themselves a new rivalry, but the falcon
scorned their efforts. Some, more hotheaded, were calling for
pistols, but the redhaired vixen flatly forbade such
violence.</p>

<p>Now as to Eudemarec, he was that time gathering morsels of
meat from the banquet. Whistling he coaxed the bird down to his
arm. He set it on an open windowsill, feeding it bits of meat on
the back of his fist.</p>

<p>In this way the Breton restored the merriment of the dance,
and condemned himself to serve as the falcon’s guardian the
rest of the darkness. For awhile the ladies were admiring the
hawk’s fierceness, until the music called them back, all but
one, small and young, hardly of an age to join that company. Her
gown was pearl gray and blue, and her mask in the fashion of a
dove.</p>

<p>‘How ferocious!’ she sighed. ‘Are you not worried lest
it attack you? For I have read that such creatures are by nature
cruel, and torment their prey before devouring it.’</p>

<p>‘Though there may be such creatures in the world, she is
not of that number. Should we condemn her for boldness, when we
will pet the lamb whose flesh will later dress our table, though
we disdain from butchering it ourselves?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know that,’ answered Zelie. ‘I had a kitten
once. She nipped my hands and left tiny dimples in my skin. But
when she grew she batted field-mice until she killed them, and
left them by my bed. I had to give her away in the end, I
couldn’t bear it any more.’</p>

<p>‘She only honored you after her fashion,’ answered
Eudemarec. ‘Later, when your claws have grown, you will
understand.’</p>

<p>‘I should like,’ said the girl, ‘to touch it; but it
will peck at me.’</p>

<p>‘I will undertake that she does not.’</p>

<p>Timidly Zelie stroked the feathers of the bird. The falcon
was eying her nervously, but made no move to attack.</p>

<p>‘Her feathers are soft,’ murmured the girl; and the
falcon spread its wings and flew out the window and was gone.</p>

<p>So Eudemarec was freed of the falcon, but now the maid Zelie
was following him everywhere, hanging on his elbow. Agnes saw
this, and contrived to draw Eudemarec apart a moment.</p>

<p>‘Eudemarec, I am Agnes. You’ll never find Arianna with
this downy chit trailing you. Would you be freed of her?’</p>

<p>‘Agnes! Is it you, indeed? But no, though I thank you,
’twould be unkind. I have already lost my chance, and I’ll
lay down my cards now, the way I’ve lost this hand.’</p>

<p>Zelie returned, tugging at Eudemarec’s sleeve:
‘Hawk-tamer, come quick, the dances are starting!’</p>

<p>These were the performed dances, and all ringed the stage to
watch the dancers. One after another the dancers thrilled the
company, until it was Mielusine’s turn.</p>

<p>She stood before the blaze of footlights for a moment.</p>

<p>The masked throng waited on her, and she was losing the
memory of her practiced steps. <i>What was the first of all my
moves, and then what came after that?</i> she was crying out
inside herself. <i>I cannot remember them all, I cannot remember
even a one of them!</i></p>

<p>Then she threw off her cloak. <i>It isn’t Mielusine facing
them, now: it is the lady in the mask of the White Hind. Let
them see only her, and let only herself guide my movements
now</i>. It was in her limbs and in her heart, the way she ruled
them now. She signed the music to commence, and she danced.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the way she had danced by herself, beautiful
though that had been. This, with all eyes devouring the sight of
her, was better. She felt the power of the mask on them all,
gentlemen and ladies: it was her power, and the music and
movements burning out of her. And it was a little drunk she was,
drunk on the desire the men were feeling for her, and the dancer
herself burning to be lying red-naked in the arms of them, every
blessed one.</p>

<p>Hidden in the burning footlights, in the midst of the throng,
stood a man unmasked. He gazed up at the bold beauty playing
with the desire of all.</p>

<p>So the Bacach first beheld Mielusine in the mask of his White
Hind.</p>

<p>The crowd surged closer to the burning footlights. From
beyond that barrier of light, the red mouth of the White Hind
bright and hot smiled beckoning back at them.</p>

<p>The trees in the burnt enchanted wood would not have known
her for their shy sweet Maid during that dance. She was so bold
she shocked even the bandits.</p>

<p>Mielusine bowed, and cloaked herself again during the
applause. Two other dancers came on, their faces glum, the way
they knew how little would be their reward for following her.</p>

<p>Behind the stage Mielusine was laughing, swimming in the love
of the admirers.</p>

<p>It was a need in her strong as breathing, to be among these
men; to stand so close that their presence embraced her, and she
was drowning in the smell of them. She could feel their gaze
upon her as hands caressing her body, and she was that
pleased.</p>

<p>‘Later, sirs!’ she told them. ‘When the others have
finished, then let you seek me in the hall.’</p>

<p>‘Will I be seeing you there?’ asked Vasquez.</p>

<p>‘If I want you to,’ she answered. The insolence of the
reply seemed native to her. She laughed, seeing him go. Hadn’t
he been right after all?</p>

<p>In the ebb, she saw the Bacach. His face seemed itself a
mask, waxen and yellow, tinged with old pain.</p>

<p>‘Do not go,’ he cried. ‘What is this mask? Do you know?
Are you the White Hind?’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m only a dancer,’ she answered, and in the press
slipped away, eluding them all, gliding into Night. It was her
pleasure just then to be swimming in the mist and witchlights
away from them all.</p>

<p>The Bacach went after her. For an instant he saw her, palely
roseate in the floating witchlights, rounding the ruined walls
of his basilica. Then she was gone. His heart was kicking, his
hands trembling, his brow chill.</p>

<p>He followed.</p>

<p>And the mists covered both of them, and the witchlights swam
on, thickening the mists with their brightness.</p>

<p>All balls must end, even that one; the music ceased, and the
ladies, the maids, and the bandits climbed the snowlike Hundred
Steps and a Step. Soon the slender young Moon would be
rising.</p>

<p>The nine young girls under Mac Bride’s command, yawning
great yawns, set to snuffing out the thousand candles.</p>

<p>Zelie, the child dressed as a dove, asked Eudemarec to escort
her to her door, and they climbed to apartments where the Breton
had never been. The girl smiled shyly. ‘Will you not step in a
moment, sir, until I may get a candle lit?’</p>

<p>‘Surely I’ll do that,’ answered Eudemarec.</p>

<p>They passed within the large carven door, they passed into
inner chambers where no witchlights swam, and all was black as
ink.</p>

<p>In the darkness the Breton heard the falling of her cloak; he
heard a rustling at the snowclad windowsill; in the open
starlight he saw the falcon lighting there. Then he turned, the
way the candle flared to the kiss of the match; and Eudemarec
beheld there Lady Arianna, unmasked, unclothed, in glory.</p>

<h3><a name="ch22">The Sixth Year of Night</a></h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the sixth year of that Night, the
students broke from their Teachers.</i></p>

<p><i>For in spite of all tricks, most students had learned
nothing, could do nothing out of the ordinary – could do no
more, in fact, than they had done during the Day. And they
blamed the Special Ones and said they hoarded their
secrets.</i></p>

<p><i>But others among the apprentices had become Masters, and
contested with their Teachers for preeminence.</i></p>

<p><i>Fellowship and brotherhood were lost. There was a
falling-out, and it came to hard words, blows, and
killing.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch23"></a> 23. How He Met the White Hind</h2>

<p class="first">AGNES did not want her masquerade to end. Upon
shining lawns beneath the dimming witchlights she danced on,
wild-souled, surrounded by a dozen bandits. But even they at the
latter end left her, despairing that she should ever reveal
herself as the lady. Alone she danced on, her skyblack skirts
swirling.</p>

<p>An odd mist hung over the ground, just about the feet. Mac
Bride’s nine girls were killing the abbey’s candles and
fires; across the lough, lights were winking on; through the
upper airs the glow of the young Moon was gleaming, and cutting
through the mist.</p>

<p>Agnes stopped, and her skirt swirled to embrace her. ‘For
luck,’ she whispered, drawing off the emerald and casting it
into the lough.</p>

<p>It splashed there softly and sank, drifting down the syrup of
the waters. It came to a rest beside the sleeping maiden
drowning in her hair, and Agnes never saw that gem again.</p>

<p>She walked about the crannog through the snow, her spirits
cooling, the mist making her cough. Every room below was still
and dark; only through the upper windows gleams of candles
reddened the mist. Even the gambling had ceased. For a time
Agnes stood quietly in the shadow of the broken basilica, under
the bell-tower. At length, alone, she turned back to her cot.</p>

<p>She found someone already there, and that was Mielusine.</p>

<p>‘Master Aengus was following me,’ the Maid told her,
‘and I feeling sorry for him. It wasn’t that way I wanted to
be meeting him. You told me he was dangerous, but he seemed a
lost little boy. This hall seemed the best hiding place, so I
asked after your bed.’</p>

<p>‘Do not go,’ breathed Agnes. ‘The other girls must be
about their duties, but let us rest together as we did before,
the way I’m so lonely. I also was thinking of him, and the
pain of it lingers, it lingers in me. Sweet Mielusine, will you
forgive me for goading you to what I would have had you
do?’</p>

<p>‘Dearest Agnes, I missed you.’ They hugged each other,
and then, still in their fine gowns white by black they lay
together in the little cot, holding tight.</p>

<p>‘Mielusine, would you be going from here?’ whispered
Agnes. ‘I am going, but you may stay if you like.’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m going. But we cannot leave Master Aengus.’</p>

<p>‘No. Eudemarec will help us rescue him.’</p>

<p>But they neither of them saw the Breton in the darknesses
that followed. He was the lady’s champion, and she hardly let
him leave her apartments; he wasn’t eager to go, either.</p>

<p>At length Arianna had herself arrayed: paraded Eudemarec down
the crescent stair, and in front of all put on his finger the
moon ring, pressing back his finger. Then Mielusine drew him
aside, where he spoke with them both in private.</p>

<p>‘Is he alive, now,’ said he, ‘and I didn’t kill him?
But that’s the finest news! Surely I’ll help you!’ He was
too happy to deny them anything. He even agreed to say nothing
to Arianna.</p>

<p>So it fell out, that on the brightness of the Moon, when
Arianna lay dreaming the deepest of dreams, Eudemarec dressed
himself, kissed her hand, and tiptoed down the stair.</p>

<p>But Agnes couldn’t help herself, and she was drawn back
into Maid Buan’s chambers, using the key she had made. She had
to look one last time into the glass on the wall there.</p>

<p>It was quiet in those rooms. Agnes stepped up to the wall and
drew back the black velvet hangings, uncovering the ornate
carvings of the frame and the dim silvery shine of the glass.
She looked deeply within. And after a time she was whispering to
herself old words out of the deep of her soul:</p>

<p class="left">…<i>set all the eyes<br>
Of court a-fire, like a burning glass,<br>
And work them into cinders, when the jewels<br>
Of twenty states adorn thee, and the light<br>
Strikes out the stars!</i></p>

<p>She stopped then, the way she felt another presence: cast her
look about, and saw Maid Buan standing in the door naked in her
bedshift.</p>

<p>Agnes let the hangings fall, but the maid caught them and
took her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>‘Is it true, now?’ asked Maid Buan in a whisper. ‘Was
it the same sight I saw in the glass, as yourself were
seeing?’</p>

<p>‘What sight did you see?’ asked Agnes.</p>

<p>‘I saw – but it couldn’t be you! But it’s truth and
nothing else this glass will show! Here now, let me look, and
you look also, and tell me what you see of me!’ And she cast
up the hangings and stood before the glass. Agnes looked there
with her.</p>

<p>She saw there a face, and it was like the maid’s face.</p>

<p>It was a face <i>like</i> the maid’s face, only stuffed and
swollen up with pride and daunting haughtiness, cold and
repellent. Agnes for shame looked away, and Maid Buan let the
hangings fall.</p>

<p>‘But you, in the mirror, now,’ the maid was murmuring,
‘you were so – so beautiful! Are you truly so fine and so
flawless as that?’</p>

<p>‘No, it’s only the artistry of the glass, and I’m no
more than you’re seeing now before you.’</p>

<p>The maid was shaking her head. ‘This,’ she answered,
‘is the artistry of the glass, that it shows back what’s
more true than the eye can see. And every moonrise I’m gazing
into it, and looking for some betterment, but every moonrise it
shows me the truth of myself, and how vain and empty a showhorse
I am. Tell me now, seamstress, what are you, that you are
unparalleled in the glass, and yet you toil here as a servant?
How is it you achieved such beauty, and can you not help me to
be overcoming that thing, that thing, now – what you saw there
in the glass?’</p>

<p>Agnes was silent, turning it over in her mind. Then she
smiled kindly and said, ‘I’ll do what I can do for you, and
the rest you must be doing for yourself. All right?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ answered Maid Buan.</p>

<p>Agnes took the maid by the hand. ‘Come,’ she said.</p>

<p>And she led the maid into her bedchamber, and led her into
her bed. The moon glow was falling strongly through the windows,
the way the maid’s rooms were high up in the tower, and near
to the thinnest layer of the mist.</p>

<p>Right away Maid Buan’s eyes closed in the moonlight, and
her face lost its lines of troubling, and her breathing grew
slower and deeper. Agnes sat on a stool beside the bed, and she
lay three flowers alongside the maid’s head, of the rose that
blooms in the night, and the hidden rose, and the Lady’s rose.
And she stroked the maid’s hand, and breathed along with her
breath for breath. The perfume of the roses lay thick about the
bed, but Agnes could see, that though the maid rested deeply,
she wasn’t dreaming. Agnes leaned in over the maid’s face,
deep into the pillow of scent of the roses, and she whispered
three words in Maid Buan’s ear, softly like a secret: ‘You
may remember.’</p>

<p>The maid’s hand clutched Agnes’ tightly, and her
breathing stopped and started. Agnes could see her in dreaming,
and softly she let go the maid’s hand and slipped out of the
chamber.</p>

<p class="break">NOW IN THE MIDDLE of that moon Maid Buan’s
eyes open, and she rises up out of her bed and summons her
serving-girl. She orders the girl to put over her Maid Buan’s
cloak, the dark one, heavy and hooded.</p>

<p>Then she takes her mask and goes out of her chambers, and
steps down the Hundred Steps and a Step, and no one is there to
meet her.</p>

<p>Maid Buan goes out through the great doors, that are hanging
open, and that is strange, the way they are never open when the
lady lies resting, and her abbey sleeps. But now they are.</p>

<p>And Maid Buan walks out to the landing, where a Swan boat is
standing waiting, with a boatman, and his head is bowed, and his
face is muffled, so naught of his features are to be seen. Maid
Buan steps into the Swan boat, and the boatman shifts with his
pole, and the Swan boat slips from the shore of the crannog in
the mist.</p>

<p>Around the lough the boatman guides the Swan boat. Maid Buan
lifts her head, and she sees the abbey all white in the mist,
turning about before her eyes. Three times they go about the
abbey, soft, stealthy, smooth, and there is no person at all to
be seen on the shore, only the white buildings of the abbey
turning in the mist.</p>

<p>And never has it shone so beautifully in the maid’s eyes
before now, the way her breath catches in her throat.</p>

<p>Now after the third time round the shore the boatman guides
the Swan boat to the landing, and Maid Buan steps up ashore
again.</p>

<p>She walks up to the great doors of the abbey, and now they
are shut before her. There is a serving-girl there working,
cleaning the bronze and carvings. And this girl is the first
soul Maid Buan has seen since leaving her chambers.</p>

<p>Maid Buan, she goes up to the girl, and hands her her mask,
and says to her,</p>

<p>‘Now let you be the Maid, and let me be taking your
place.’</p>

<p>The girl says not a word, but she takes the mask, and Maid
Buan’s heavy cloak, and the maid puts on the girl’s homespun
dress.</p>

<p>The girl she goes away, and Maid Buan now is all alone, and a
Maid about the place no longer. And she takes the rags in her
hand, and she touches them to the bronze and the carvings of the
great doors, and she sets herself to cleaning them.</p>

<p class="break">AND WHEN THE MOON rose next, and the light of
the Moon glowed in the mist again, Buan was done with her work
for that darkness, and she went to where she knew the
serving-girls slept, and she found the cot of that girl who wore
the mask of Maid Buan in the chambers high above. Buan lay
herself down and rested, and when the Moon sank again she rose
up and went to the great doors, and she cleaned them again.</p>

<p>There was a carving in the door, and it a girl’s head, very
lovely, but made green and dark by the mists of the lough. Each
darkness Buan was cleaning that carving, and it coming lighter
and more burnished under the touch of her hand, and that work
did Buan’s soul good, and was setting her at peace with her
heart. She loved that carving and that face, and the great
doors, and what she did with them.</p>

<p class="break">NOW AS TO THE BACACH, he had shut himself up in
his rooms those darknesses, and was searching the stars in his
telescope. His ate little but drank deeply, of the rainwater
that fell in buckets on the bell-tower roof. But sometimes when
the Moon was brightest, he crept about the forsaken lawns,
looking for the hind.</p>

<p>Servants came and left him food. They came in silence and
darkness, the way they were not disturbing him. The Bacach
hardly noticed them. But when one of them opened the door
loudly, and held a glaring candle before her, the candle burned
his eyes; he cursed her and bade her begone.</p>

<p>‘I will begone, and you will be gone along with me,’ she
answered. ‘Master Aengus, come.’</p>

<p>She was in white, and she wore the body of a woman, but she
was the White Hind.</p>

<p>He climbed down out of the sky, slowly.</p>

<p>‘You are here,’ he said. ‘You are real.’</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him. He took it: there was no
substance in it. His frozen, nerveless fingers felt nothing.</p>

<p>They went down onto the lawn. Agnes was waiting there.</p>

<p>‘How is he?’ she asked. ‘Aengus, how goes it with
you?’</p>

<p>‘I’m numb,’ he answered, looking on his White Hind.</p>

<p>‘Here is Eudemarec,’ whispered Mielusine.</p>

<p>The Breton stopped short at the sight of Agnes. ‘Why, what
new metamorphosis is this?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Agnes smiled and bowed to him. Her hair was clubbed in a
queue, and she wore a tricorn hat, boots, breeches, and
waistcoat beneath a cóta mór. ‘Don’t I make a pretty boy?
I learned well enough how skirts and silks fare on the
road.’</p>

<p>Eudemarec laughed.</p>

<p>‘You have a familiar look to me,’ said the Bacach.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you know me?’ asked Eudemarec.</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘I am the man who killed you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said the Bacach.</p>

<p>‘And are you really the love-mad Irish farmer, put out the
sun? Are you Master Aengus, indeed?’</p>

<p>‘I am the Bacach. I draw the cards for Arianna.’</p>

<p>‘You must draw mine some time.’</p>

<p>The man reached into his pocket and drew out a card at hazard
on his fingertips. The Breton turned it over: it showed a man
walking the road, his belongings slung on his shoulder, a pup
nipping at his heels. ‘Il Matto,’ Eudemarec read. ‘What
does it mean?’</p>

<p>‘It means, farewell,’ answered the Bacach.</p>

<p>Mielusine murmured, nervously, ‘Let us be going.’</p>

<p>They passed under the abbey in silence, to the mooring pole
and Swan Boats.</p>

<p>‘One we will take, and the rest burn,’ Agnes said.
‘They’ll not soon be on our trail.’</p>

<p>‘That is not the way,’ spoke a voice from the
darkness.</p>

<p>‘Who’s there?’ asked Eudemarec.</p>

<p>‘Let you not harm him, he is a friend,’ said Agnes.</p>

<p>He came out of the blackness north of the abbey, walking
slowly, like a heron, he was so tall and lean. His smile was
crooked as his legs.</p>

<p>‘Greetings, Miss,’ he said sardonically.</p>

<p>‘Mary bless you, Mac Bride,’ she answered. ‘And what
brings you out under the fullness of the Moon?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, as to that,’ he murmured, in a sing song tone, with
a long sideways look at the Bacach, ‘It was ever my pleasure
to be strolling by the lakeside. But what have we here? Is it a
war-party I’m looking on?’</p>

<p>‘We’re leaving, Mac Bride.’</p>

<p>‘Then have a fair voyage, Miss, and Mary speed you to your
destination!’</p>

<p>‘Mac Bride, Master Aengus is going with us.’</p>

<p>At that the old countryman turned, looking from the face of
the Bacach to Mielusine’s mask. ‘Is he, now?’ he
muttered.</p>

<p>‘Don’t try to stop us, old man,’ warned Eudemarec. He
put a pistol to Mac Bride’s breast. ‘It wouldn’t be worth
the pain of it, you see.’</p>

<p>‘Stop it now, and put aside the gun!’ cried Agnes
sharply. ‘Mac Bride, Aengus is a dead man here in this place.
We’re taking him off to restore him to himself. Will you help
us?’</p>

<p>‘You’d never be doing it this way,’ he told her. ‘The
lady knows this scheme already; she had it in a dream. The fire
will rouse them, and they’ll be on your trail before you lose
sight of the crannog.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a gamble we’re ready to take,’ said the
Breton.</p>

<p>‘Is there another way for it?’ asked Agnes.</p>

<p>The old countryman looked on her quietly, in the strangest
way. He was on the very verge of speaking, and yet holding his
tongue.</p>

<p>From one of the windows a light gleamed, and the casement
swung out. In the candlelight Agnes knew the face of Old Meg,
looking down on them all with an evil intent. For a moment she
stared; then ducked away back into the hall.</p>

<p>‘Please, Mac Bride,’ pleaded Agnes. ‘We haven’t the
time. You helped him once with a good heart. Can you stand by
now, and be his jailer?’</p>

<p>He said, very gently, ‘Your heart has changed, Miss.’</p>

<p>‘You are lovely,’ said the Bacach to Mielusine.
‘You’ll not run from me again, will you?’</p>

<p>A door banged open in the servants’ building, and three
burly men approached. They were Arianna’s ferrymen, roused by
Meg. ‘What are you doing there?’ they demanded. At the sight
of the Bacach they scowled. It was worth the worst of
Arianna’s wrath to let the Bacach get away off the lough. Ever
since he had been killed in the duel across the lough, this was
her strictest command.</p>

<p>‘Be at ease,’ said Eudemarec calmly, showing them the
ring. ‘I am her champion. She sends me to escort these three
into the forest and show them the right path.’</p>

<p>‘Lady Arianna said he wasn’t to go. Only Arianna can say
anything other than that.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I think I can show you the fallacy in your
argument,’ answered Eudemarec, and drew out a brace of
pistols, leveled at their belts.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ he said coolly, ‘there are three of you, and
I’ve but the two pistols; so if you have the blood of Turks,
you may yet overpower me and fulfill your command, which I
maintain is a false one, the way it’s herself is sending me
here. But then two of you will die with balls in your bellies.
Choose between you which, for ’tis a matter of indifference to
me.’</p>

<p>The ferrymen stood glaring at him.</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said Eudemarec after a bit: ‘if you want
to live, stand over by the mooring pole, and untie the
boat.’</p>

<p>‘This is not the way,’ said Mac Bride. ‘Leave them and
their boats, the way others will be coming to work on them, and
the alarm will soon be sounding.’</p>

<p>‘Is there another way?’ asked Agnes.</p>

<p>The countryman nodded. ‘There is one.’</p>

<p>They trooped along the crannog, the countryman and Agnes, the
ferrymen, Eudemarec, Mielusine and the Bacach. They passed the
casino, the Lady Chapel, and the servants’ quarters. They
rounded the basilica and went quietly past the byre, where the
blood hounds whined and scratched the earth at the sight of
Eudemarec. Close to Arianna’s garden, the lean old man
stopped.</p>

<p>He sat on his heels over the water, and fished in it a little
with his long, bony hand. It was the candle burning in the eyes
of himself, was giving him the strangest look.</p>

<p>‘It was long ago, long,’ he told them. ‘When the
crannog was built, we made a secret causeway, the way we would
never be needing boats if we hadn’t any, if we had the wisdom.
We piled up stones almost to the surface of the water, deep
enough so as not to be seen by the eye, and following a tortuous
path. My daughter used it once of a time,’ he said. Then he
stretched out his arm and took her hand. ‘’Tis a path I
know; feel it now, and don’t be forgetting.’</p>

<p>With his fingernail almost cutting her palm, Mac Bride traced
in Agatha’s hand the twisting and the turning of the causeway
out of the crannog. The flesh of her palm was streaked white
like lightning, showing the path.</p>

<p>‘There’s no need for this, you know,’ she told him.
‘Come with us, Mac Bride. We’ll have use for you.’</p>

<p>But the old man shook his head. ‘I’ll not be such a
traitor, Miss. And this is the way of it, if you want to win
Aengus for yourself, it’s you must do the doing of it, not I.
Go on then, and let her bless you! The boy was ever a soft point
in my heart. It runs in the family, as you might say.’</p>

<p>‘Eudemarec, at least let you be coming with us,’ she
begged. ‘Arianna will hold it against you.’</p>

<p>‘I will win her round, never fear,’ he said with a grin.
‘She is not evil. I would know evil in her. Neither is she
good. She dwells with beauty, and beauty has its own law.
She’ll not betray her love. And if she does … why, then I
lose the wager! It would be worse to see her no more.’</p>

<p>‘If you are going, go now,’ said Mac Bride. ‘Look to
the Moon, how high she is.’</p>

<p>With that, the old man left them, back into the abbey, and
did there whatever it was that he did. Mac Bride kept his own
accounts.</p>

<p>‘Bless you, old friend,’ called Agnes after him.</p>

<p>She dipped her booted foot into the lough, probing: found the
causeway stones. She slogged forward, splashing; behind her came
Mielusine, holding her skirts in one hand and Agnes’ hand in
the other. The Bacach followed them awkwardly into the dark
water.</p>

<p>Step after step, turning upon turning: they walked upon the
water deeper and deeper into the lough, like three magicians.</p>

<p>‘Go with my love, Agnes,’ called Eudemarec after them
softly, watching the three of them whitely blending into mist.
‘Win back the memory of your lover, the way he cannot know you
but love you.’</p>

<p>He turned back to the ferrymen. He leaned against the wall of
her garden, looking them up and down. ‘’Tis the brightness
of the Moon,’ he said. ‘A long one. You’ve not by any
chance got a pack of cards about you, do you?’</p>

<p class="break">ALL THAT MOON Eudemarec held the three ferrymen
captive; and Agnes and Mielusine led the Bacach past his grave
up through the orchards. Along the way they passed a small ring
of hand-small stones set in a vantage point. The paths were
beaten bare through the white snow, and Agnes climbing easily
and swiftly. But the man with his limp could go but haltingly,
and the women had often to help him.</p>

<p>When the Moon set they took a bit of rest, then started on
their way again. They went on after moonrise, while the
brightness passed over their heads. They had climbed very high
by then, and were close to the end of the mist.</p>

<p>But when the Moon sank, then the man fell on his knees for
very weariness, clutching at his thigh.</p>

<p>‘Get up, come along,’ urged Agnes.</p>

<p>‘He cannot be going any more,’ answered Mielusine, ‘And
we’ve not the strength to carry him.’</p>

<p>‘Do you not,’ said Agnes, ‘see that we are at the very
edge of this county of mist? I can see stars over my head, where
the mist is thin! – But what sound is that, now? Merciful
Mary!’</p>

<p class="break">THIS WAS THE WAY the Lady Arianna rose out of
her dreams, with a rich slow stretching and coaxing of blood
back into her limbs. She was smiling to be thinking of her new
beloved; but she found the room empty beside herself.</p>

<p>Down she looked from her window to the Swan boats, and knew
something was amiss.</p>

<p>Eudemarec met her at the casino door with the ferrymen at his
back. He hid nothing from her, and confessed all.</p>

<p>‘Did I not deny you this already?’ she asked him coldly.
He had broken his promise to Agnes, you see, and spoken of it to
the lady after all. ‘Well, but I will forgive you the one
naughtiness; after all, timid men are none to my liking. Your
fault will be undone, though, the way I will be finding him and
bringing him back to me; as for these women, now, I don’t care
what befalls them, so long as it is none of it good. And what
will you do now, Eudemarec, to make this up to me?’</p>

<p>He smiled, and kissed her palm. When the darkness was ending,
they went up to her chambers, and were no more seen. She was
very tender with him that time, and wept tears over him in her
joy.</p>

<p>But when Eudemarec woke out of a dream by moonlight, he saw
that Arianna’s ring was no longer his. His fingers were bare.
Then an overmastering fear took him, and he left her side, even
as Gwangior had done and fifty others before him, and he fled
into the wild orchards after Agnes and Mielusine.</p>

<p>Behind the Breton a dark man covered in a tricorn and a dark
gray cóta mór took another Swan boat and rowed himself across
the lough. He stepped atop a hill into the ring of hand-small
stones, and watched the Breton fleeing.</p>

<p>The Moon sank, and the darkness gleamed off the face of the
waters of mist lapping the tall abbey. Arianna rose, and called
her girls, and had them bring her hunting dress.</p>

<p class="break">‘IT IS HER PACK,’ said the lame man,
listening. ‘It is the lady’s blood hounds, and Arianna is
hunting again.’</p>

<p>The sound gave back some strength to him, the way it was
taking his thoughts away from his leg. He stood up, flanked by
the woman and the White Hind on the hill side, looking back down
into the mists. The baying and the howling of hounds were
growing through the ghostly trees.</p>

<p>‘They are coming this way,’ whispered Mielusine through
her mask. ‘Are they hunting us?’</p>

<p>‘It may be,’ said the man. ‘It may be the lady. She
wants a new blood hound.’</p>

<p>‘Come on, then,’ begged Agnes, plucking at their
sleeves.</p>

<p>They went on their way as best they could. Mielusine was
leading the way, her strong thighs easily pushing away the ice.
It was the man who stumbled, on nothing at all, at the very lip
of the ridge, with the waves of mist breaking just over their
heads. And ever behind them was swelling the baying of the
hounds, to a frenzy.</p>

<p>And blending with the hounds’ cries another howling reached
their ears: inhuman, from a human throat.</p>

<p>‘Eudemarec!’ moaned Agnes.</p>

<p>Mielusine was stilled, and the Bacach bent back his head,
kneeling below her white skirts. But Agnes, weeping and cursing
at her friend’s fate, plucked at their coats, and pulled them
up and after her.</p>

<p>‘Let you be hurrying, let us go on,’ she said moaning,
‘we must go on out of this awful deadly mist.’</p>

<p class="break">SO THEY FLED out of that county. And in the
dark of the moon a hundred riders sallied forth, passing with
wild whoops of joy beneath the branches of the orchards, out
into the bare land on the lady’s greatest of all kailees, to
hunt down and fetch back her Bacach, no matter how long it would
be taking them. The moonbeams made a path for the robbers to be
following, and there was only Grain’s shore where the lovers
might be finding haven. But they had never heard of Grain as
yet.</p>

<p>The man in the dark gray cóta mór saw Eudemarec’s end,
and the pack of hounds scattering back down to the lough. He
watched all that with a grim face, showing no more concern than
a hanging judge.</p>

<p>Then he stood and slung the old quiver and bow across his
shoulders, and took up the lovers’ trail.</p>

<h2><a name="ch24"></a> 24. Of the Dwellers in the Night</h2>

<p class="first">IN THE LAST summer of Day, while the King’s
men tracked down Master Aengus, the ripe hay grass in the fields
the countryfolk worked for the good of their landlords had
shaken in the wind. The grass had shaken because it was tall. It
had shaken because it would not be tall for long.</p>

<p>In the Night the kings were dead. The houses of parliament
stood empty. The lords that did not lie abed sleeping stood
begging on the open roads. Generals and admirals gave their
orders to the winds. The seas were empty but for the most
desperate of men, and they half piratical. Princes of the church
fared no better than their brothers of the state. The Wakeful
trusted more strongly in the good people in the mead than in the
gods in the cathedrals, now open to wind and rain. Mary was
worshipped, but as if she had been Morgan or Aphrodite.</p>

<p>In Day, the Sun had showed what was, and what had been, and
what must be. In the dark there was only the suggestion of what
could be, what might have been, and what yet may come. The
contrast fed ambitions. Now there was a choice.</p>

<p>In Day some, like Master Aengus, had carried their darkness
about with them. Now all those who had lived through the fire
had made their peace with darkness. And in the bargain, darkness
had showed them – wonderful things.</p>

<p>It was a transfiguration not only of the world, but of the
men as well.</p>

<p>In Day, what had they done? Plowed fields, sowed seeds, dried
hay, dug roots, mined peat, fished the deep, stocked cellars,
wove and sowed, cooked, ate, spoke of the old subjects, fed
fires against the cold. Each of them penned in by what he did,
how much land he owned or tilled, what his church was, what
tongue he spoke, who his father had been, and his father’s
father… In the Night all that was forgotten.</p>

<p>The children showed them the way. The children loved the
Night, the way all those children who had bad dreams in darkness
were sleeping; and the waking children never knew a better
holiday, and laughed, and took the grownups by the hand, and
were showing them the way.</p>

<p>It was as though all those Wakeful had paused: stood still in
their forward-going, let the towers of the world come crashing
down, and looked about them out of altered eyes, pondering what
they might build out of moon-painted fields.</p>

<p>Nowhere was this felt more strongly than among Tinkers.</p>

<p>The Tinker had known the Night of old. Not for him was
working the day long like the tenants, and sleeping through the
night to be strong for more work. The Tinker owned the open
roads, and slept beneath the stars, and watched the wild winds
tearing the dark cold nights of winter. The Tinker had been
waiting for the dark. Tinker lads and lasses were born with the
dark in their blood.</p>

<p>Their grandparents had ruled these hills and rocks. Once they
had been masters. Then foreigners had come from the sea, there
had been battles and blood, and the old masters were struck down
into bondage. In time new foreigners had come from the sea, and
again there had been battles and blood, and the old masters
struck down into bondage.</p>

<p>Seven times it had happened in the Irish land. Seven new
races of masters, seven new races of slaves.</p>

<p>Only a few of those beaten never submitted, but they went
into the hills, into the bogs, and into the wild heart of the
land. They built their houses on wheels, the way no land was
left them that would not soon be taken back away from them. They
lived by their wits and their courage, and spat on the roadside
when anyone spoke of the Law. And they were known as Tinkers,
though many a folk called them <i>Clan Ulcin</i>, that is to
say, the Children of Evil.</p>

<p>Now in the Night amongst all the Wakeful the Tinkers were
sowing bawdy songs, whispers of unspeakable deeds, and willful
desires; and they were plowing darkness over those dreaming
fields, dressing them to bear what was never known before.
Animals dream only when they sleep, and so had the cottagers
done, forgetting their dreams in daylight.</p>

<p>There was no more daylight now, thanks to Master Aengus and
his mad love.</p>

<p>It was a rarity of Ireland, the Innis Fodhla, that so many of
her tramps were descended from her former rulers, dispossessed
and hunted, too stubborn or proud to leave. They were the
gleanings left behind by invasion, war and rebellion. And if the
cottagers had forgotten their heritage, their heritage had not
been forgetting them.</p>

<p>And now the cottagers were dreaming with open eyes as the
Tinkers had done, and breathing in the hot smoke of the
Tinkers’ open wild fires.</p>

<p>And it was as if Black Eden had come back to Innis Fodhla,
and they were freed after a thousand years of servitude.</p>

<p>And through it all the dark man in his cóta mór, the Man
Who Should Have Slept, went walking with his longbow and quiver
across his shoulders, shaking his head and muttering, ‘Shame,
now! Shame, shame, shame!’</p>

<p>Then he bent his head, and took up again the traces of the
lovers’ trail.</p>

<h1><a name="part4"></a> Part IV. <br>
The Waning of the Moon</h1>

<h2><a name="ch25"></a>25. How They Fled</h2>

<p class="first">ACROSS SILVER FIELDS beneath ice-clad stars,
Agnes and Mielusine led the Bacach, down to the western coast,
after what was left of the roads of day. They entered into
lowlands empty and still beneath the Moon. The winds were frosty
out of the north, though Imbolc came soon enough and Brigid’s
fires, and by the reckoning of Day Winter’s end was nearing.
Powdery snow was still falling, even in the lowlands, even on
the coast, turning the black land white.</p>

<p>All that season they were fleeing, fleeing through the snow,
fleeing over ice. Now and again they would be stopping on hills
or lookout points. Through the lands below they could see bands
of bright-hued riders, women and men, roving through the fields:
the lost nobility of the Night: Firbolgs, Tuatha de Danaan,
Celts, Normans, Tinkers and robbers, and every blessed one of
them Arianna’s.</p>

<p>All those folk were scouring the lands for the Bacach; once
they almost caught him, and were riding over the bridge Agnes
hid him under. Mielusine’s horns were scraping the old stones
over their heads, and the pounding of hooves ringing in their
ears, and the man shaking for cold, the way the ice was swimming
round his socks. Agnes coughed until a dark red stained her
sleeve.</p>

<p>She led them up higher, on the moors. She led them over the
spines of the Sliabh-na-Mban. There were no Wakeful there. Now
and again they were finding a broken-down farm, and Agnes was
digging spuds and turnips for them. Even so they were
starving.</p>

<p>Cold waxed that summer, colder still. The Snow-Cold Summer
that summer was called, by those that Woke in it. Agnes swore it
had never been so cold in Ireland in Day. And if the Sun did not
return, she knew, colder and colder each summer would burn,
until all the world was frozen dead as ice, and Arianna ruled
over a frozen waste.</p>

<p>Dotting the white fields were the standing stones, left there
from long ago, the way that they were called the beds of Diarmid
and Grainne. In hollows of such stones, out of the snow, they
lay down all three together, overlapping their coats. To Agnes
the cold was a bright knife in her lungs, cutting her with
coughing. As for Mielusine, though herself was healthy, her
splendid white dress was trailing tatters, and she looking the
ghost in her mask.</p>

<p>Always, Mielusine wore the mask of the White Hind upon her
face. Only when the man lay dreaming would Agnes let Mielusine
put off the mask.</p>

<p>‘But he’s only the worse for it,’ said Mielusine.
‘His love is turning into longing from such closeness. It’s
in his eyes, have you not seen it? It’s an enchantment growing
over me like sin. When he’s looking at me, he’s seeing
something else.’</p>

<p>‘When you’re wearing it he adores you, and is that so
dreadful? But let you be fighting the enchantment his eyes are
weaving for you, or you’ll be lost for ever.’</p>

<p>‘’Tis only the mask he loves, and never me at all.’ But
in her heart Mielusine was wondering.</p>

<p>‘Black and red and white are the colors of my love,’ the
man was singing, as they trudged along their way.</p>

<p class="left">‘Red and black and white is she.<br>
White is her body, pale as the<br>
Snow of one night;<br>
And red is her collar of red gold and her horns,<br>
That are redder than crushed fox-glove;<br>
And black are her eyes with the riddle of skies.</p>

<p class="left">‘Black and red and white are the colors of my
love,<br>
Red and black and white is she.<br>
My love will wear no colors,<br>
Only black, only white;<br>
But when she is red, then there is no color<br>
Anywhere else in the world.’</p>

<p>So the long cold darkness wore on, with never an end of
fleeing for them, chased after by all the mighty of the
Night.</p>

<p class="break">THERE WAS A SNOW falling, and they sitting
under another bridge upon a stream of ice. Mielusine lay
dreaming of food; Agnes sat up waking with the man, they both of
them looking on the dancer in her dreams.</p>

<p><i>It is the mask</i>, Agnes was thinking. But she knew
better.</p>

<p>The Maid had been just the proper sort of prettiness, in her
coloring, her form, and her heart. Herself, Agnes, had polished
her into the consummation Aengus would have most desired.
She’d foreseen this end from its beginning. She’d meant for
it to happen. But still she envied Mielusine, the way she was
yet beautiful, and the end of his desire.</p>

<p>‘Aengus,’ she whispered. ‘Aengus.’</p>

<p>‘Yes?’</p>

<p>‘Do you know that you are Master Aengus then, and not the
Bacach?’</p>

<p>‘I know that is how you are calling me.’</p>

<p>‘Do you still remember nothing?’</p>

<p>‘I have visions, and perhaps they are coming from the past,
and perhaps they are yet to be.’</p>

<p>‘And do you remember how you cursed me? You cursed me with
desire for you, when you put out the Sun.’</p>

<p>‘Aye, so you have told me.’</p>

<p>‘It is truth,’ she said, and kissed him.</p>

<p>It was only his mouth against hers she was feeling, and not a
kiss at all. He was longing for the White Hind, and she could
never be that for him.</p>

<p>‘Do not be crying, Agnes,’ he said softly. And it was
hating him surely that she was then.</p>

<p>It snowed blackness for a long while round that bridge. A fit
of coughing shook Agnes, near breaking her ribs. The man lay
down dreaming, and Agnes bent over the girl, tugging off the
mask. She was looking at it a long while.</p>

<p>When the clouds broke and the moon whitened the world again,
Agnes told Mielusine to put the mask on.</p>

<p>‘Do you know where you are leading us?’ asked the dancer.
‘Where there is a town, and people, and warmth?’</p>

<p>‘Go back to Lough Mask then, and your rich life in the
abbey if you’re unhappy.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot be wearing this mask any more. It is so heavy it
will choke me!’</p>

<p>‘You’re whimpering like a child, can’t you at least be
still?’</p>

<p class="break">IN THE END, Mielusine would not wear the mask.
She put it off, and let him see her face. It seemed to make no
difference to the man.</p>

<p>Hard was the going in the snow, deep as it was. It was caking
to their shoes, and the ground underneath ragged and
treacherous.</p>

<p>Agnes came to her senses. ‘What’s that I’m
seeing?’</p>

<p>‘Is it will o’ the wisps?’ asked the maid.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said the man, ‘those are <i>her</i> folk.’</p>

<p>Wan yellow lights were flickering and weaving down the slopes
to the left of them, to the right of them, before them and
behind. Now Agnes could see them clearly. They were lanterns. In
a great narrowing ring the bandits and minxes were closing on
them. A shout reached their ears, followed by a pistol shot. One
of the bandits had seen them.</p>

<p>In bounds the bandits’ horses were climbing the snows,
kicking up drifts behind them.</p>

<p>The yellow lanterns were swinging by the saddles, and the
dark cloaks of the horsewomen and horsemen billowing in the
winds, and their black scarves over their faces showing only
their eyebrows and piercing, wicked eyes. Closer and closer they
came.</p>

<p>They rode the hill side, sweeping it in circles, until
they’d covered it all, and not a cat’s space was untrodden
by their horses’ hooves. But they met only one another, and
none of those three. The bandits and minxes looked one another
in the eye, fiercely; then they laughed, relishing the chase,
and raced away down the hill towards the nearest wood, a small
crop of black in the white waste.</p>

<p class="break">IT WAS THE MAN of the three, had found the low
mound underneath the snow with a little tunnel leading into it.
The tunnel was lined with undressed stones, and at its end a
little round chamber. The man gathered oddments of dry turf
there with moss and leaves and grass, and started a fire. The
ruddy flames were cheering Mielusine, and she smiling for the
first time since Arianna’s masquerade.</p>

<p>‘It’s faster our clothing would be drying if we took it
off,’ said Agnes.</p>

<p>‘That would be immodest,’ protested Mielusine.</p>

<p>‘Since when did a dancer complain of modesty?’</p>

<p>‘Do not be speaking to her in such a voice,’ commanded
the man.</p>

<p>Agnes was that disgusted with them, she went out into a
hollow in the snow on the hill side. Where she coughed, and
hugged herself for warmth, and kept a lookout for bandits. She
felt at her belt under her cóta mór, where she’d hidden a
scian dagger. The clouds were clearing, and she looked into the
stars, and they the stars of Lughnasadh.</p>

<p>‘Lughnasadh, and here I am sitting in snow, and not a blade
of green grass to be seen,’ she said. And she looked out
across the land.</p>

<p>Soon enough in spite of the snow, she could see firelights
burning from every hilltop. Round the fires the robbers were
gathering, lured there by the Tinkers to their old, wicked
rites. For a time at least the three would be safe.</p>

<p>Alone, hugging her knees to her breasts, Agnes was shivering,
and at length her eyes closed, and she was resting.</p>

<p>It was the first time the man and Mielusine had been alone
together, since the masquerade…</p>

<p class="break">AGNES was dreaming of Aengus and the dancer
inside the hill. She was seeing the Maid sitting by the fire,
and she was seeing Aengus looking on the Maid.</p>

<p>There was a silence in the barrow. Those two had nothing to
be saying to each other.</p>

<p>At the first, Mielusine would be looking away from Aengus’
gaze. She would not wish to acknowledge him so openly. At length
she would look sidelong at him: and seeing his look, and his
piebald body, red and white, she could not help but smile. He
would smile too.</p>

<p>Agnes saw the whole of it in her dream. She knew them both so
well, the way she had lived alongside one from two years’
time, the way she had taught the other every look and manner to
be having with a man.</p>

<p>The dancer would have risen then, and glanced down on her
ruined dress. Surely it was in a sorry state! And shyly
Mielusine would remove it, turning her back, her shoulder
veiling her mouth, hiding its secrets. Quickly she’d shiver on
her other dress, the red, red dress, that would be crimsoning
all the barrow even to the fire. She would be feeling warmer
then, less timid, less reserved.</p>

<p>Her own beauty would be seducing her as much as anything
Aengus might think or do. But she would be thinking to herself,
What is it he sees, looking on me so? It was in her own eyes,
herself as no longer Mielusine, but as the Hind, that magical
creature of all his dreams and longings. What a trap that
was!</p>

<p>He was very near to her. There was that wonder in his eyes.
With one fire-warmed finger he traced a line down her brow, past
her ear, down her throat, to the hollow of her collar.</p>

<p>Mielusine shuddered at that touch, even as herself, Agnes,
had once on a time shuddered at it, and felt the tingle of it
descending into the hollow of her breasts.</p>

<p>He was holding the mask before her. Perhaps that slight
movement of her head was but the last wave of her shudder. He
put the mask onto her, and she did not deny him. Her dark eyes
peered out childishly from the cutout eyes.</p>

<p>It was afraid she was then, as Agnes had not been on the
falling of the Night, all at once afraid: of him and of his
eyes, of his longing for the thing she was not, of the touch of
his hands on her body.</p>

<p>And Mielusine would be remembering what herself, Agnes, had
told her, long ago in her lessons:</p>

<p>‘Do not stop for fear. It is the very sign of love, fear
is. Passion will mark you and change you forever, it’s that
you’ll be fearing. A great lady will feel fear the first time,
the first time it is real. She’ll not be flinching for that,
but she’ll seize the nettle every time. It’s that that makes
her great.’</p>

<p>So the Maid would only shiver, not deny, as Aengus laid bare
her body, pale and soft and delicate as new-fallen snow.</p>

<p>Her skin gleaming roselike in the fire. The floral scent of
her escaping from captivity, mingling with the smoke. And Aengus
drinking it in. Mielusine sighing, leaning back, and raising her
arms above her head.</p>

<p>She was in a sort of Mesmeric trance. She felt her heart
beating through the long veins of her throat, but her senses
were numb to all else but his touch, and the physical possession
of his gaze. Aengus reached up and touched, ever so lightly, the
insides of her tiny wrists. How he’d loved doing so to
Agatha’s wrists! He ran his hands like silent snowfalls down
along the outside of her arms. Mielusine would feel every one of
the invisible, downy hairs of her arms responding to the passing
fingertips.</p>

<p>As to Aengus now, he would love the delicate, fragrant hairs
that flowered in the rounded hollows underneath her arms. He’d
be loving the slender, arching throat. The tiny, half-buried
breasts and their burning tips. The limbs stretching out long
and glimmering, and quivering chastely at his touch, as if
shivering at some sudden chill.</p>

<p>He would kiss her open lips beneath the mask, and she
clutching his hair in her hands would force him hard and deep
down on her lips; and when at last she let him break that kiss,
then Mielusine would sigh, and a single note would escape her
lips, sweet and pure as a child’s, like the note she’d sung
on the dark road way.</p>

<p class="break">AGNES heard that note. Even out on the hill
side in the snow, she heard it.</p>

<p>With eyes shut fast she saw it, all and all of it. It was as
if herself, Agnes, lay in Master Aengus’ arms beside the fire.
She envied Mielusine Aengus’ love; envied Aengus his perfect,
foolish passion.</p>

<p>She bore the dancer no ill heart. It was the White Hind she
was hating, the way it was the Hind truly possessing Aengus, and
the Hind her only rival.</p>

<p>‘Och, Aengus,’ she groaned into her knees, ‘Aengus, now
has your name become Agony to me…’</p>

<p>She coughed another red spot into her palm. She lay in a ball
inside her coat, and at last she dreamed again.</p>

<p>When she roused herself the Moon was sinking, and a flock of
black birds flying against it. The needfires were dark and dead.
Agnes found something in the snow beside her.</p>

<p>It was the mask of the White Hind.</p>

<p>When she ventured down into the barrow, she found Aengus
lying in his somber clothing by the gray ashes. Mielusine was
gone. The red dress was still there, folded up neatly as though
she’d never put it on.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26"></a>26. Of Their Quarreling</h2>

<p class="first">THEY WENT on their way, the two of them, the
man and Agnes. They followed the dancer’s tracks in the
snow.</p>

<p>‘Where is the White Hind?’ he was asking. And she
answering, ‘Gone ahead, and left you this mask. We’re to
follow.’</p>

<p>‘But why did she not take me along?’</p>

<p>‘The White Hind flies like the wind when she’s a mind to,
and you are slow, and lame. Take care, or I’ll leave you
too.’</p>

<p>They sat under a hedge. Above them three dark women went past
against the stars, speaking Gaeilgte on a hill.</p>

<p>Aengus lay dreaming, and Agnes went apart and tried on the
mask. But she couldn’t squeeze her face through the narrow
opening.</p>

<p>From his dreams the man rose groaning, tears rolling down his
cheek like ink.</p>

<p>‘I dreamt I saw the White Hind,’ he told her. ‘She was
going down a lane, and mayflies swam in the light like gold
dust. There was a dark man beside the Hind. He was leading her
by a leash tied to her golden collar, and they were going away
from me. They were beautiful together. O Man, I hate you. You
have the White Hind, you alone of all, and you boast of
it.’</p>

<p>‘Aengus, what befell when you tried to summon back the
Sun?’</p>

<p>‘It was some place by the Sea. I was forbidden entrance.
Oh, I cannot recall.’</p>

<p>‘Bring back the Sun, Aengus. You swore you would. I put
that task on you.’</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p class="break">ALONG THE WAY they came by the side of a
curious house, tall and crooked. In the topmost window one light
was burning, and Agnes was leading him away from that place,
when the door creaked open, and someone came out after them,
calling ‘Agnes! Agnes!’</p>

<p>She went back to the house. The doorway was dark, but the
stars glinting off the snow showed a figure standing there,
gathered up in black folds. The figure moved – it was a woman,
after all: dressed all in black, veiled in black lace, and only
her bosom bare.</p>

<p>‘Agnes,’ she called, ‘Agnes, girl, is it you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered.</p>

<p>Lady Ann the cottager once, the Lady-trollop now, took her
aside and spoke quick words to her.</p>

<p>‘Agnes, you must go with soft steps. I’ve sent my man out
to be finding you, and here you are on my doorstep! There’s
someone tracking you, and he means you no good by the look of
him. Only six moons past he was here, eating off my platters,
and drinking my ale, and talking away. Be careful, now, he’s
surely near here!’</p>

<p>‘Who is it?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ answered Lady Ann, ‘it’s the Man Who Should
Have Slept, to be sure! Didn’t you know he was no friend to
you and yours?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered, ‘but I thank you for the
warning.’</p>

<p>‘Let her bless you, my girl! If it weren’t for you I’d
never been a lady!’ But already Lady Ann’s voice was
softened by the snow, the way Agnes was hurrying back on her
tracks, and thankfully finding the man still leaning upon the
broken tree. She took his hand, and led him away as quickly as
he might go.</p>

<p class="break">THEY FOLLOWED the dancer’s tracks in the
snow. In a valley, the footsteps were covered by the tracks of
many horses; and on a stony hill where the wind had blown away
the snow, they lost the trail.</p>

<p>‘I know where she has gone,’ said Agnes. But she led him
away from where they had been following. Meek as a child he
followed her.</p>

<p>‘Aengus,’ she called back to him.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’ It was no more than a whisper, that voice of
his.</p>

<p>‘What day would it be, if we still had days?’</p>

<p>He looked up at the stars. ‘August the twenty
seventh.’</p>

<p>‘And it’s winter, still?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘What is happening? What’s become of the world?’</p>

<p>‘It’s Night, and the Lady is pining for her Bacach.’</p>

<p>Mostly the snows they were light, but some were heavy and
drifting. Trails vanished beneath them and the going was gallous
heavy.</p>

<p>And little they knew of it, but wherever they went they were
followed, and wherever they stopped they were watched from the
hilltop behind them. The tall gaunt man buttoned up his cóta
mór against the snows, and silently tracked the lovers.</p>

<p class="break">ONE DARKNESS she left Aengus sleeping, and she
went around a wood. She climbed a snow-clad wall, and looked
across a rising of fields in a coat of silver and snow. Looked,
and there beyond a hedge she saw the high stone manor house that
she had left.</p>

<p>It was silent and dark beneath the snow. There were no
lights, no scent of smoke. Inside, the rich men and their
ladies, all of the Lady Agatha’s friends, were sleeping still
in their beds. The thickness of their sleeping wrapt around the
house and its grounds.</p>

<p>Round the grounds some riders were riding, and they wearing
the black and scarlet cloaks of the county of mist. But she got
past them, and slipped up the hedge alongside the snow-covered
drive.</p>

<p>And she was thinking, no doubt, of the wood and dried peat
Mac Bride had stacked there, all ready now for the burning. She
was that tired now; cruelly, heavily tired. Her rests had turned
deeper and sweeter in the cold. Her dreams had turned so
beautiful…</p>

<p>Somehow she managed, by the merest crack, to open the
servants’ door, and she slid into the shadowy interior. She
was that thin after her long traveling. The door shut fast
behind her.</p>

<p>Moonlight and starlight were shining off the snow and glowing
through the ice-stained windows, with a still, soft, blueness,
and she stepped quietly, with the grace of a girl going into
church, painfully aware of the echo of every step she makes.</p>

<p>She walked through the downstairs hall, through the dining
rooms and public rooms, and she thought of being there long ago,
on her twenty-first birthday.</p>

<p><i>That</i>, she thought, <i>was years ago; and yet in days
not very long ago; am I older now, or am I still only
twenty-one? The Sun hasn’t gone round but half a year since
then. But no, what am I thinking? The Sun hasn’t gone around
at all.</i></p>

<p>So thinking, strangely, she climbed the servants’ stairs.
Out into the upper hall she came. Where for a time she stood,
looking on the door to the lord’s room. The great door bent
half open, showing her a glimpse of the bed, where she had lain
alongside Master Aengus.</p>

<p>The rest of the doors in the hall were closed and shut fast.
A torpor like the fullness of sleeping after too heavy a meal on
an early summer’s afternoon, that was weighing on her, slowing
her steps and slowing her thoughts, like the dust slowly turning
in the snow-glow through the windows. Once more out of habit,
like a dream, she tried the doors to the Sleepers’
bedchambers: and now one doorlatch turned for her, and the door
seemed almost ready to yield. She muttered over it words she
learned from Master Aengus’ tables and parchments: pushed open
the door and stepped in.</p>

<p>The door in her hand was drawing back to close itself, but,
taken by a notion that if she let the door close on her she
would be trapped there, and tumble down in sleeping till the end
of the world, she held it firmly, while she bent forward and
down over the figure wrapped up in sheets and bedclothes like a
mummy.</p>

<p>‘Sir James! Sir James, can you hear me?’</p>

<p>And she murmured a bit of something else out of Master
Aengus’ tables.</p>

<p>And the snow whirled up outside the window, and the door
leapt to close itself, and almost snatched itself out of her
hand, but she held it fast – and the Sleeper’s breast rose
and fell in a sigh, and his lips parted, and one cheek
twitched.</p>

<p>‘Sir James, what is it you’re seeing? Can you not see
me?’</p>

<p>And a branch threw itself against the window in the wind, and
the Sleeper’s eyelids twitched, and underneath them the balls
of his eyes darted about.</p>

<p>‘Sir James, what is it you’re feeling? Can you not feel
my hand?’</p>

<p>And she reached out and took hold of his thumb.</p>

<p>Then his eyes flew open, his nose snorted in a breath of cold
air, his lips parted – his face was full of dread and horror
at something – something in the room about him which she could
not herself see – and his eyes rolled about, caught sight of
her, and for a moment seemed to know her, and sought to warn
her, of the dreadfulness of dreams, of the evil of the Night, of
the emptiness of desire – when the door leapt back to its
jamb, pulling her back, her hand wrenching away from him, and he
lapsing at once into a deathlike mask of sleep. Until she fell
out into the hall again.</p>

<p>She breathed there uneasily, and felt in the air about her
the hostility of the Sleepers, meant for her.</p>

<p><i>It’s not</i>, she thought to herself, <i>waking
they’re wanting – not so long as the Night lasts. How
dreadful Night must appear to them, that are not used to it</i>.
And she thought, <i>They are dreaming of Day, and let them dream
on, without the hindrance of my meddling.</i></p>

<p>She descended the front steps and went out the main doors,
and saw on the drive nine of Arianna’s rogues and jades
awaiting her.</p>

<p>One laughed, and drew his silver pistol, and thumbed back the
hammer of it.</p>

<p>Very still she stood there. But she would not go back into
the house. So she stepped down to meet them.</p>

<p>‘You may take me,’ she told them, ‘and do your worst to
me; but you’ll never win him back into that jail.’</p>

<p>One of the bandits jumping down off his horse strode to her,
and knelt in the snow in front of her.</p>

<p>‘Lady,’ he said, ‘we’ve no wish to be hurting you.
You may come along with us now, or go another way, as pleases
yourself. It’s only the Bacach we’re seeking, to carry him
back into the mist, and into the crannog. And that for his own
welfare, the way there is many a danger for him out in this
country. And most harmful of all is that place,’ he said,
raising his arm at the house, ‘the way that place, if it find
the Bacach again, will see him die and fall down into dust.
Never let him come here! Never let him see its walls
again!’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she told him, ‘for your kindness. Only,
why are you helping me? I’m no friend to the Night or any of
you all!’</p>

<p>‘Lady, do not be wronging yourself so! You cleaned the
Hundred Steps and a Step, did you not? And do you think any
daughter of Day could be doing that?’</p>

<p>Down the long drive she walked, and along either hand of her
the robbers and jades in their scarlet and black cloaks bowed,
and took off their hats to her. But still in her heart she
didn’t trust them, so she went first to the lake, the desolate
lake. Where for a time she listened to the wind crying in the
dead dry sedge along the ice, crying, ‘Always! Always!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, and we’ll see about that,’ she said, and when the
Moon went down into the hill she gave the riders the slip and
stole away back to him.</p>

<p class="break">SHE LED the man down along the Bride. Bandits
hidden in the village almost captured him, but knowing the lay
of that land, Agnes eluded them, and she took the man away
eastaways, across the Blackwater and across the Suir.</p>

<p>A flock of black birds, bigger than crows, flew over their
heads, and Agnes felt ill at ease. Were birds not Arianna’s
messengers?</p>

<p>‘I feel kinship with the birds,’ said the man, looking up
after them. ‘I want to be free like them. Birds, let you be
coming back for me!’</p>

<p class="break">‘IT WAS EVER strange fancies taking your
heart,’ she told him, walking in the moonshade of a
hedgerow.</p>

<p>After a while he said, ‘What was I like, before?’</p>

<p>And she began to tell him of himself, of the ruined man
he’d been, and how he’d wooed her, and how he’d drowned
the Sun to win her, and vowed to bring it back.</p>

<p>He only said, ‘It’s the White Hind I remember, and
nothing at all before her.’</p>

<p>‘It’s lying you are,’ she answered him. ‘You do
remember. You remember it all. You only say you can’t recall
it, the way you couldn’t be facing me otherwise.’</p>

<p>They did not speak after that. They went a long way together,
fleeing the bandits, hiding under hedges and rocks in the high
places.</p>

<p>The man was carrying the mask, looking on it always.</p>

<p>‘Why do you seek the White Hind? What is it you are looking
for, then?’</p>

<p>‘I look for myself,’ he answered, gazing on the mask.</p>

<p>‘Are you lost, then?’</p>

<p>‘I am here, but my wholeness is missing.’</p>

<p>‘Go away, Master Aengus! Go where you will never see her,
never hear of her, where no one will bring her to your
mind!’</p>

<p>After a long while, the man sighed, and lay down with the
mask cradled in his arms. He sang, softly, a mad song:</p>

<p class="left">‘Over the earth is moving the wind<br>
Relentlessly; I stand here<br>
Still; she at the back of the wind<br>
And beyond.</p>

<p class="left">‘She travels here, she travels there<br>
Wherever her fancy leads;<br>
But her fancy never leads her<br>
Where I am.’</p>

<p>She stared at him. She pulled at him, but the man wouldn’t
be budging from that place, and so she must lie down beside him,
and lay the half of her cóta mór across him to warm his
crippled leg.</p>

<p>Slowly the stars wheeled into and out of clouds.</p>

<p>About the middle of the darkness Agnes rose, and she took the
mask of the White Hind away from him, and going far apart she
put it under hard earth beneath the snow.</p>

<p>And she left him, and walked by herself in the snowy
Night.</p>

<p>It was three moons, she did not go back to him.</p>

<p class="break">MEANWHILE the Bacach lay dreaming in the snow.
He didn’t know that Agnes had risen from his side, or that she
had stolen away the mask, or that she had gone away. He didn’t
know that the Man Who Should Have Slept was even then sharpening
the points on his arrows. He didn’t know that something else
was watching after him from a bit of wood on a nearby hill. That
was a little beast of the wood, pale as the snow, delicate and
arching as a willow, with small silver horns and a golden torc
twisted round her neck.</p>

<p>The Bacach lay dreaming while the White Hind slipped out of
the wood and crept down softly to his side. He lay dreaming
still while the dark man appeared on a far-off hill, and raised
his bow, and shot an arrow into the beast.</p>

<p>The White Hind took the arrow full in her throat, and she
staggered, and tarried, dreadful tarrying; she swayed a little
over the man laid out on the snow before she fell, heavy
falling; and she died.</p>

<p>The man in the dark gray cóta mór stepped down over the
Bacach, and troubled his leg with the tip of his boot. The
Bacach stirred, but the man bent over and whispered to him,
‘Now, now, brother, don’t trouble yourself! It’s nobody
that’s here, it’s nobody at all, only your long lost beloved
brother Fergus, come to pay a call! Dream now and stay dreaming!
Dream of your love lying and dying for love in your arms.’</p>

<p>The dark man laughed, and uncovered his face. And his face
was ghastly and grim and mad, the way he hadn’t dreamed in all
the months of the Night. He couldn’t be dreaming, you see, and
he didn’t dare rest, for fear he might fall asleep like all
the Sleepers. Because he was the Man Who Should Have Slept.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said he, grinning, ‘my brother Aengus, won’t
you even bid your dear brother Fergus good-evening? It’s so
long since we grew up together, and swore ever to be true to
each other, when we mingled our blood together. Where are your
fancies, airs, and powers now? Who studied better, you or I? And
who learned best?</p>

<p>‘You stayed at home after our father fell, but myself, I
took the rebel road, and I went across the Sea for it, and
worked on the work of our land, and you doing nothing but
studying after your heart’s desire. And I hated you for that,
and for the traitor you are.</p>

<p>‘I knew it was your work, when I saw the black spot on the
Sun,’ he said. ‘It was in a far land I was then, but I still
found the needed ingredients to mix a brew to keep me wakeful in
spite of anything you or the old man could do! Oh, this Night of
yours is a fine thing, brother, if it let me come back to my
homeland, and kiss my kin once more.’</p>

<p>And he said, ‘Oh, I came back again to the Bride, and I
waited and watched, until I found your trail. You let my love
die, brother, and you stood by while the King’s men hounded me
out of home and country, but you never were thinking that one
fine night would see me revenged on you!’</p>

<p>The dark man slung off his bow, and put that into the
Bacach’s hand; he slung off his pouch of arrows, and tucked it
up under the Bacach’s arm.</p>

<p>And he took up and brandished a sword in his hand.</p>

<p>‘What are you thinking, brother Aengus, that you find me
with our father’s sword? It was me should have gotten it, not
you; I found it again in the Night; it was in a dead hound’s
breast; fancy that, right where you left it! You’ll not get
this back again!’</p>

<p>The Man Who Should Have Slept turned and left the Bacach with
a laugh. And after a time the Bacach was freeing himself out of
his dreaming, and stirring and opening his eyes.</p>

<p>He sighed, and saw at his feet a lady stretched out, as
lovely as the lee. She was dressed all in white, torn and ragged
and airy as lace. Her long throat was arching up his thigh where
the old wound beat, and her head in his lap, and in her throat
an arrow, and the blood from the arrow staining all the front of
her gown, and the snow also all about her skirts and feet and
where he sat was red, red with her cold, cold blood.</p>

<p>For a time he was staring at the dead woman stretched out on
the snow. He had never seen her before, never in his life; but
there was something about her, something – and then he saw in
her pale brow by the start of her dark hair two small nodes like
the start of silver horns, and round her throat a torc of
twisted gold.</p>

<p>The man looked down and saw in his hand his grandfather’s
longbow, and a quiver of arrows alongside his leg. He looked up,
and his hands cast aside the bow and arrows, and his eyes saw
that three blackbirds were flying across the clouds by the Moon,
high up away from the Earth.</p>

<p>His cry was choked off under the clouds, and few would have
guessed it came out of a human throat.</p>

<h2><a name="ch27"></a>27. Of the Dark Wood</h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS THREE MOONS, Agnes did not go back to
him. Then she found his tracks and followed them.</p>

<p>A line of wagons crossed her path. The wagons were
brightly-painted and clad with tin, and the pans and pails
hanging from the sides rang and clattered like rain.</p>

<p>‘Let her love you, young man! And what are you doing
walking through the gentle Night, alone?’</p>

<p>‘It’s searching I am for another. Tall and dark he is,
with one white lock, and not strong, the way he is limping. Have
you seen him?’</p>

<p>‘Not the buckle of his shoe. But climb up with us, and if
we find him on the way, you will, too.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve got to be finding him, do you see. His wits are
limping too, and I don’t know what will become of him.’</p>

<p>‘Climb up, and we’ll keep a sharp eye out! We are going
to the Fire – do you not count the stars? I’m Bera, and
these are my girls Brigit and Buana. And you now, young man,
what are we to be calling you?’</p>

<p>She answered, softly, ‘Aengus.’</p>

<p>The old Tinker woman smiled a smile that split the whole of
her face in two. She held out her hand. ‘Aengus, climb up, and
we’ll look for your friend along the way.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered, and taking the woman by the hand,
she went up beside the daughters on the plank seat.</p>

<p>The line of wagons sang and rang, down dale, up slope, with
lanterns swinging like fire-flies from their tails. Alongside
the wagons went many on horseback: some Tinkers like the
wagoneers, but the rest wild women and men with pistols and
scians at their belts, and eyes bright in the dark. Arianna’s
bandits and jades, hunting the Bacach. But they didn’t know
her on Bera’s wagon, the way she was another Tinker, and in
disguise.</p>

<p>The Tinker girls talked to her, and laid their hands along
her knee, and she must be telling them something of herself and
the man she was looking for, but she could never remember,
afterward, what it was she told them. In her heart she was
cursing herself for the harsh words she’d lain on him. In the
middle of it she broke down coughing, and staining her
handkerchief red, so Bera put her back in the wagon and laid her
down, and one of the girls lay alongside of her for warmth. They
clucked their tongues and turned their eyes sorry-wise, and the
mother shook her head. Then the two girls quarreled over which
of themselves would be getting to lie alongside the young man to
warm him.</p>

<p>But Agnes was drifting in warm and in dozing, deep into the
deep. Dim and faint she was hearing them quarreling, and the
words of the tale their ma was telling them to keep them still
and attentive; so far away it seemed to her, so far herself
seemed from herself!</p>

<p>‘But didn’t she fight against it?’ asked Buana.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it wasn’t that she didn’t,’ answered Bera from
the front. ‘But what was it she could do?’</p>

<p>‘Run away,’ said Brigit.</p>

<p>‘Fie now,’ said Bera. ‘She was only a girl, and the
other was the Lady of the Lough! Only a few of the gentle people
could have stood up to her. And less than a few would have
defied her as Princess Maeve was doing.’</p>

<p>Agnes closed her eyes, listening to the Tinker women talking
on about the fairy tales as though they were truth.</p>

<p>‘And when will the curse be put off her?’ asked Brigit,
the way in stories there is always a way to put off curses, and
the way is always found, unlike in life.</p>

<p>‘This is the way of it,’ answered the mother, ‘that
Princess Maeve will only return to her own shape upon her
betrothal to Prince Og. But Prince Og defied the lady, and she
cursed him with forgetfulness, and exile in the Day-land,
forever, and there in that place he fell in love with a human
girl, a daughter of Adam; and as to Princess Maeve, she followed
another path.’</p>

<p>‘Hush now,’ whispered Buana, ‘you’ll be waking young
Aengus from his dreaming.’ Agnes felt the brush of soft lips
across her brow, and a fragrant breath murmuring, ‘Dream,
sweet man, dream.’ So she did.</p>

<p>It wasn’t they not knowing, was she woman or man. It was
only they letting people be what they wanted to be. She wore a
man’s clothes and a man’s name; so it was a young man the
girls tended to, and a young man they carried in their wagon,
and laid down on the outer circle in the red light of the
needfire.</p>

<p>The heat of the great fire was blackening the hill, melting
the snow even outside the rings of wagons, and warming the
ground. And the heat of the Fire washed over the young man on
the ground in three great waves. It dried her hair, it dried her
clothes, it dried her flesh and bones.</p>

<p class="break">SHE SAT UP, looking in the Fire.</p>

<p>It was a huge beehive risen on the hill. The flames were
spiraling up and about, wreathing into smoke. And from one hand
a dozen lasses came out of the dark, bearing over their heads a
great nest of wildflowers, primroses and brambles, blooming even
in the snow in the Night. And atop that nest lay the body of a
girl all in white, tattered and airy as lace, with a great red
scarf wrapped round and round her throat, and a golden torc
clasping round the scarf.</p>

<p>The lasses took the nest up to the needfire, and they shifted
to place it on the top, so that the flames withered the roses
and wildflowers, and the thorns sparked, and the body of the
dead girl was joining with the smoke, and becoming no more than
air itself.</p>

<p>About the needfire were gathered a thousand or more of the
bandits and jades, Arianna’s folk. And on the far side of the
fire Agnes could see a fine fair carriage, drawn by twelve
horses, and Arianna herself was standing there, grieving.</p>

<p>‘But who was she?’ Agnes was asking. To which one in
passing answered in low tones,</p>

<p>‘’Twas one well-loved by the old Man of the Bog. But she
is flown now with the birds.’</p>

<p>Then Arianna turned on her heel, and went up inside her
carriage; her coachman cracked his whip, and lady and robbers
and jades rode galloping away into the Night-land, searching for
her Bacach as they had done for moon upon moon, with gallous
small success.</p>

<p>At which the Tinker lasses and youths came ringing the fire
again, and were grasping one another’s outstretched hands, and
beginning a slow somber dance. In time the steps of them flashed
quicker, the way it was not for long they could be withholding
their joy in the great vast spaces of the Night-land. The last
of the robber women and men were dancing with them, and their
silver spurs were flashing in the fire. From out of the dark on
every hand others were climbing, carrying bundles of twigs and
logs and many other things, and casting them onto the pile.</p>

<p>More of them came, curious folk, boys and girls, and bent old
people, and many tongues were spoken among them, and there
seemed no lack of understanding. They wore the dress of
different lands; some were fair and some were dark, and some in
finery and some in rags. But there was a look and a gleam in the
eye of all of them, so that they seemed all kindred.</p>

<p>A child came up to her with a cípín of birch in his
hand.</p>

<p>‘What are you burning?’ she asked the child.</p>

<p>‘Whatever we want,’ answered the child, and asked her,
shyly, ‘What do <i>you</i> want?’</p>

<p>Bitterly she shook her head. The child moved on around the
fire, and she reached into her sack, and took out a book, much
used, so that the title on the spine had worn out with
smoothness.</p>

<p>It was the book she had loved so, when she had lived, and the
Sun had shone.</p>

<p>She let the old thing fall open to any page, and she read
there: and the words came back to her, so that she could keep on
reading them, even closing her eyes, even closing the book.</p>

<p>And unsteadily she rose, and stepped forward, and the dancers
broke their ring for her, and she stood inside it. The great
breath of the flames was burning into her face, like hot summer
sunshine, and against it she narrowed her eyes, and breathed in
fire. And she cast the book on the fire. Sparks and ash flew out
of its lies into her eyes, drawing out tears. She looked through
the tears and saw a woman on the yonder side of the fire.</p>

<p>This woman was dancing alone around the fire, dressed in a
cloak reddened by the flames, proudly glowing and alluring with
the sins of the flesh. The woman paused in the turns of her
reels, and her shadowy, mysterious eyes caught Agnes’ own.
Then the woman danced on, and others joined the circle.</p>

<p>‘Come dance,’ sang Brigit, beckoning, ‘with us, Aengus!
Take my hand with me!’</p>

<p>‘Nay, now,’ answered Buana. ‘It’s with me Aengus will
be dancing!’ But the young man shook her head, and quietly
stepped back to the dark edge of the fire.</p>

<p>The rush of the ring swept the Tinker girls round out of
sight on the fire’s far side, shrieking and laughing. Children
were dancing after them, seven children in a row: they were
Agnes’ children. All at once they caught sight of her and
pointed her out, singing, ‘We know who <i>you</i> are! We know
what <i>your</i> heart desires!’</p>

<p>She looked on them with no words in her at all. Then the
dread of them took hold of her, and she slipped away into the
darkness, and went down the hill side to a dark wood, ingrown
and tangled with brambles and dense dead bushes.</p>

<p>She had nothing then. She had lost her lord and manor house,
and her friends of the day, and Mielusine, and her beauty, and
her hope, and her book, and Aengus.</p>

<p class="break">ROUND THE WOOD she walked, looking for a trail,
until the glow of the needfire was only a lost smudge of red in
the sky beyond the twisted, thick, black boughs.</p>

<p>Some cottagers were living beside the wood, themselves coarse
as homespun, still brown after those years without the Sun.
Agnes thought them quite the loveliest people she had ever
seen.</p>

<p>‘Mary love you, surely we been watching the trails,’ they
said, giving her a failte and sitting her before a smoky peat
fire on the only seat in the cottage, and it old, and in no good
repair. It was odd, they to be burning turf and living at the
edge of a wood.</p>

<p>‘We always watch for strangers and suchlike, it been hard
to get some things since all went dark. You now, Miss, have you
any goods?’</p>

<p>She could only offer them a hank of tobacco out of one of her
coat pockets; they snatched it up gleefully and reddened their
dudeens at the fire. But they knew nothing of Aengus.</p>

<p>‘Nay, now, none has been afore you for ever so long –
seven moon or more: and them bandits on horses hot on the chase
of something, but we hid from all them. All’s we gets is the
madman in the wood. He howl, he howl, Lady! Whenas he’s close,
it’s damned little rest we can be getting, the way he howl.
Listen! There, now! Och, why don’t merciful Mary send him down
a well, or break trees over his head!’</p>

<p>Outside the cottage Agnes heard a dim moan. It grew to a
yell, a shriek. The cottagers’ children stopped up their ears.
It went on and on, longer than a human voice might last. Then it
broke, and faded away.</p>

<p>‘Moy-rua, he’s been doing it for ever,’ they told her.
‘He’s devil-haunted, poor miserable creature. And when he
howl, we may churn and churn, but no butter will come. Why
can’t that blasted devil chase him crost to the far side of
the wood? – Or bring clouds in on bright moons. That’s when
he’s worst, whenas the Moon’s most brightest.’</p>

<p>But Agnes felt her blood chill, the way that cry was in his
voice.</p>

<p>And she went from the cottagers, burdened with jars of
berries, and bags of nuts. Puffing happily on their pipes, the
woman and man sent her off with a blessing.</p>

<p>‘Be well, be merry, Miss in a man’s breeches! Let her
keep you warm and dry! Go east now, skirt the blue bogs, and
you’ll be finding Grain’s county alongside the Sea. She
maybe will be curing you. Do not be going into the wood, it’s
an evil, nought but badness dwells there.’</p>

<p>‘Let her bless you,’ said Agnes, kissing the both of
them.</p>

<p>She left the cottage behind her on her right hand, trailing
round the wood, stepping closer and closer in to it. The eye of
the spying Moon discomfited her.</p>

<p>The wall of brambles, tangled dead weeds, brake and bush
shifted warily past her. Over the brambles she could see dead,
white, rotting trunks; crooked branches curling low; black
leaves bunching, blotting out the stars. She heard the rooting
of boars, the rustle of small sneaking things, and owls and
birds of the night. And she heard the cries of Master Aengus,
gone mad in the middle of that wood. But there was no path
through that wall.</p>

<p>She bent down by the wall of the wood, feeling the tangles.
It was like wicker, and stronger than stone walls, the way not
even cannonballs might have breached it. In some places the
weeds were woven close as woolen mittens.</p>

<p>She dipped her hands into the weeds, taking them back with a
shudder when thorns cut her palm.</p>

<p>The dampness breathed through her coat. She was feeling a
burning round her brow and a dryness in her throat ever since
she slept on the snowy hill side.</p>

<p>And after a time she felt an opening in the wall.</p>

<p>It was a dark hole down on the ground, half-covered with a
fringe of grass. It must have been a fox’s path; but if she
left the bags of nuts and berries outside, and took off her
cóta mór, she might just squeeze into it.</p>

<p>The brambles coiled about her inside the black tunnel. Her
breeches were wet with mire. Where the brambles crossed the
tunnel she took them carefully between her fingers, bent them
down and put her knee upon them. Behind her, her knees, cut by
the brambles, left little curling trails of blood. She crawled
further ahead, reaching her hand into the black.</p>

<p>Where her hand touched a thing, slender and slight. She took
it into her bosom, and went on crawling.</p>

<p>The Moon must have fallen while Agnes was creeping down the
tunnel. Weary as she was, seeing nothing at all about her, she
dared not stop, the way she might be meeting some beast coming
out from the far end.</p>

<p>At last she won clear. She crawled up a little mossy knoll,
where the ground was some less damp, and there, in darkness, she
let her limbs bend back out straight, until the soreness was
fading and she could dream.</p>

<p>The Moon was peering through the branches when Agnes rose. On
the broken trunk of the tree over her, she saw in the moonlight
two words, crudely scratched out of the bark, one above the
other:</p>

<p class="center">GODDESS<br>
STOP</p>

<p>Agnes traced the letters with her fingertips. Then she took
out of her bosom the card she’d found in the tunnel. There was
a couple drawn on the card, a man and a woman, both red naked,
chained by collars on their wrists beneath a winged giant.</p>

<p><i>Il Diavolo</i>, the card read.</p>

<p>And once more the stars wheeled round to touch the Samhain
mark, when all souls and dreams are loosed. And for four and
twenty hours the Moon did not rise nor shine.</p>

<h3>The Seventh Year of Night</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the seventh year of that Night, the
Masters, those who Woke and Spoke to the Strong Places in the
Night-Land, put forth their Powers.</i></p>

<p><i>They Cast Out the other Waking away from the Strong
Places.</i> <i>And they raised stones or air or water or fire
about the Strong Places, and forbade the others from every
walking there again.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch28"></a>28. How She Sang to Him</h2>

<p class="first">SHE WANDERED through the wood. In the
brightness of the moon she heard the raging of the madman. The
black leaves shook with his birdlike cries.</p>

<p>Her stockings, shirt and breeches were shredded by brambles,
her shoes muddied and torn. Her hair was full of twigs and
leaves, and the fear of Arianna’s bandits was in her, the way
she could hear their hunting horns sounding outside the wood.</p>

<p>Could they hear him crying, too? Could they tell his voice,
that voice that no other man was ever using?</p>

<p>On tree trunks she cut the thin grooves of his name, AENGUS.
But she found no other scratchings beside the first.</p>

<p>‘Come down to me, Aengus,’ she was calling. ‘Come down
out of the branches of trees. Let your feet feel the ground
again: behold in my eyes the sight of the man that once you
were: not so wild, not so driven by the winds, but mine.’</p>

<p>She knew he was near. But he did not answer.</p>

<p>She was drinking from a stream, and saw pale wood chips
floating past her on the dark water. There were twelve, and then
one larger.</p>

<p>‘Aengus, did you send me these? What did you mean by
it?’</p>

<p>Agnes built a hut of fallen branches, ferns, and brambles.
She made fires there, warming her bed. Her hut breathed blue
smoke in the darkness, filling the wood and leading her home.</p>

<p>She hoped he would be lured by the smell of her cooking, and
built a nest for him up a nearby tree. She rested dreaming that
he was there; and when she might not dream she spoke to him,
hoping her words like the smell of her fire would be reaching
him.</p>

<p>‘Don’t go, Aengus, come back! Let me warm your
rain-chilled body, let me soothe your chafed red hands!’</p>

<p>But he never came or answered.</p>

<p>And she found a hollowed log, lined it with leaves and put
food in it beneath the trees. It was often empty. Was it Aengus
who ate it, or a badger?</p>

<p>The dark of the moon came circling back. That cold was the
bitterest ever. The stream froze over, and the branches cracked
in the blackness loud as pistol shots. And her cough deepened,
like a plague cough, like a death cough.</p>

<p>It seemed to her he had become the wood, and the wood was
him. Gathering berries from a rowan tree, she thought he must
have eaten some. Hearing the owl screech, she thought he heard
it too. The creak of branches in the wind spoke with his voice.
It couldn’t be anyone else’s, the way there were no other
people left in the world.</p>

<p>Through the black claws of branches, she gazed upon the Moon.
She was the Samhain Moon, and herself so cold, and Winter still
waiting to be born. And what, she wondered, would that Winter be
after a Summer of snow and ice? She’d never live to see its
end.</p>

<p>‘Is this our Eden, Aengus?’ she said to him from the door
of her hut. ‘Is this our Paradise?’</p>

<p>That darkness she crept out into the glen. Something huddled
over her tray. It started at her presence, spread its wings and
flew into the tree.</p>

<p>‘Aengus, don’t go! I can tell you the beginning of your
pain, and it’s only I can set you free of it!’</p>

<p>There was no sound or stirring answering her, but still and
all Agnes sat against the hut, sending her thoughts far back;
and she told him:</p>

<p>‘It was the first of May, it was, and the Sun was hot and
bright, and all the ladies riding to the lake. Dame Letitia and
Lady Felicia were speaking of their lovers, but I, I had nothing
to say.</p>

<p>‘And across the lake I saw a dark and solitary man. He was
standing on a rock gazing down into the lake. He didn’t even
cast a glance our way. Miss Cecily told me it was a farmer
without friends, and he was often seen on the meads with his
dog; a cold, backward man, but something of a philosopher.</p>

<p>‘Then under my breath I was saying, “Never, Master
Aengus, will you be happy without love; and never while the Sun
shines will you love anyone but me.” Then all at once a black
swan flew up from the lake, and out of all the ladies by the
lakeside your dark eye fell on me.</p>

<p>‘I blushed hot as foxglove, repenting my rash words. I had
to look away at once, the way I couldn’t after tell whether
you but glanced at me or stared all the while we were there.</p>

<p>‘After that, I had your house pointed out to me, lonely and
apart, half fallen from neglect. I heard the tales they told
about you. Once or twice I even saw you, walking in our
preserve.</p>

<p>‘I had never noticed you nor heard your name before. Now it
seemed you were ever in my path. I had loved looking out my
windows on the meadows; now it was always you there, dark and
still and watching. The morning after a rain I found footsteps
in my flower beds, and knew that they were yours. I thought,
“What does he want? Why does he haunt me?” Oh Aengus, why
could you not have been foolish and light like any other
lover?</p>

<p>‘Talk of the mad farmer who chased me was ever on my
friends’ laughing lips. And I thought after all, it was only
proper that you love me. It was none of them who’d won your
heart.</p>

<p>‘Then you were gone away,’ she added, after awhile.</p>

<p>‘You stood no more upon the meadow grass, there were no
more footsteps under my rosebeds. Your house, half shambles,
came to be shunned. It was easier without you, yes! Never again
did I think of you, I swear, until the night before the last
day. It was ever on such a night that you would come for me.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t miss you. But I mightn’t sleep that night. I
couldn’t breathe, I opened my windows and you were there.</p>

<p>‘Then all at once I longed for you as I longed for no other
man. You were unhandsome, and the sweat of the horrible thing
that you’d done came gleaming off your brow. I did not know my
longing was but a trick, a thing you put on me. I stepped back
to be away from you, but when you entered I took hold of you and
kissed you, viciously, and laughed…’</p>

<p>Agnes hugged her knees to her breast, rocking slightly back
and forth.</p>

<p>‘I said what I said by the side of the lake, and that was
the start of it all, for you, for me…’</p>

<p>And a cry came croaking down to her, hardly human, the way
she had trouble making it out: two words:</p>

<p>‘Why, lady?’</p>

<p class="break">‘WHY, AGATHA?’</p>

<p>She was pacing the woods, weighted by his question. Why had
she spoken those words by the lake? Why Aengus? And why word her
geis in that way? She tried to recollect herself as she had been
on that bright day, but that one was a stranger to her now. Only
the wooing of her geis stood out in her mind, unforgotten.</p>

<p>She left him food on the tray, as before; when the Moon rose
the food was untouched. She knew he hungered for her food. She
knew he starved for it. One darkness, at last, he ate of it.</p>

<p>Come moonrise Agnes found him lying on the moss beside the
tray. Her herbs had put peace in him.</p>

<p>It was a great black crow she was looking at, with one white
feather on its wing, a bent leg, and human eyes.</p>

<p>She took him in by her little fire, and cradled him in the
crook of her arm. While he slept she was silent, listening to
the wood. She heard an owl screech very near. Then the fancy
seized her that Arianna was there; she covered the fire and
scooped leaves over both their bodies to hide them.</p>

<p>‘Now I’ve grown half as mad as you,’ she muttered.
‘But while I hold you I’ll never let you go, let lady and
bandits come as they like.’</p>

<p>At length she rested. It came onto her slowly, in stages, and
this was the way of it. First she was aware of his breathing,
the rustle of leaves at his breathing. Then it was the rapid
beating of his birdlike heart she was hearing, deep under the
feathers. Her own heartbeat she heard as well. And she thinking,
<i>If music has the power to charm, so does love have strength
to heal, and let my love now heal your poor burning brain, my
Aengus, though I am so tired.</i></p>

<p>She felt her own heart slowing. So she rested.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes he was gone. There was only a
feather caught in her sleeve.</p>

<p>She saw him across the glen, crouching on a root, ready to
flit up into the branches. But his feathered form was larger
now, and he was almost a man again.</p>

<p>‘Aengus,’ she cooed sleepily, holding out her arms.
‘Come again.’</p>

<p>And warily, like one half-tamed, he hopped down off the root
and came back to her, walking with darting steps.</p>

<p>She took his hands in hers.</p>

<p>‘We must go now,’ she said. ‘We must find shelter, and
a way to summon back yourself. Even if it means losing you.
Aengus, will you come with me?’</p>

<p>The way he looked at her he might still have been a crow.</p>

<p>Firmly she took his hand, and led him out of the wood.</p>

<p class="break">IN THE FIELDS they were wandering in snow up to
her waist, though the stars were harvest stars, and Winter after
being born. They went down south and eastaways, down to the
Irish Sea.</p>

<p>They went by starlight, and hid in the shadow of a hedge or
rock by moonlight, when the lanterns crossed the distant hills,
and the bandits’ horns were blowing. Agnes let drape the long
braid of her hair down between them while they dreamed.</p>

<p>She was dreaming of flowers springing up and growing strong,
taking her strength, like Day being born out of her bones. Her
coughing was hindering her, and weakness and weariness, and a
rising tide of sleep, dark and sluggish as death.</p>

<p>From the hilltop behind them they were still watched.</p>

<p>The woman stumbled and could go no more. The pair of them lay
down in the snow under a hawthorn tree, the way there was no
other shelter to be found. When the Moon rose, she shone down on
them like an evil lantern lighting the bandits’ way.</p>

<p>Through the icy mist hanging over them like tent cloths,
Agnes was watching the Moon. ‘Aengus,’ she murmured, ‘are
you there? I am burning. Fetch me water.’</p>

<p>Aengus melted snow in the hollow of his hands, and she licked
at it. They had nothing better to be eating. He looked on her,
saying nothing. But it seemed to her a bit of reason was
returning to his eyes. Or was it her reason was failing?</p>

<p>That moon she lay in the hollow under the hawthorn tree,
waking and dreaming dreadful dreams. She knew she must find
strength to move on with the darkness. But when it came, she
hadn’t.</p>

<p>With the next moon her fever had lessened, but herself
weaker. She was no better on the next darkness, or the next, or
the darkness after that. But already they had tarried there too
long. They must be going.</p>

<p>He was lifting her, and she leaning against him, and he
hobbling with her, and they step by step going down a hill.</p>

<p>That walk was torment to her. Her head was thrown back
against his shoulder, and she feeling the ground through his
stagger, and the stars moving and jigging with them, like her
starry black skirts.</p>

<p class="break">‘AENGUS, Aengus, set me down.’</p>

<p>It was later, and the Moon was glaring through the clouds.
Blown snow was a forest now.</p>

<p>She lay back on the snow. It felt so good that she lost all
care for anything except to go on lying there until the dawn. In
the back of her mind the flowers were blooming, tall in the Sun
above her bones in the dark Night of the Earth.</p>

<p>She rolled back her head on the snow. On the hill side near
them a cave was opening. ‘We must go in there,’ she
murmured. ‘We must go out of moonlight. But I cannot…’</p>

<p>It was bliss to cease even the little effort of speech. She
had no desire. Sure, and this is what the angels feel.</p>

<p>Mutely the man knelt over her, hiding her face from the Moon.
He watched her, but she did not move.</p>

<p>It began to snow again. He took off his chaplet of laurel and
laid it on her hand. He picked her up, and took her into the
cave.</p>

<p>From the hilltop a figure was climbing down after them. He
was a dark man, dressed in a tricorn, a muffler, and a long dark
gray cóta mór.</p>

<p>The dark man stepped down to the cave-mouth. For a time he
was standing there. Then with a turn of his head he strode
forward.</p>

<p class="break">FAR AHEAD, deep in the hill side, among the
warmth of the stones, the man carried the woman. The cave
stretching on before him, and he following it, down and up
again, until it was ending, and he coming out the far side, into
a green meadow, into a grianan. There was the tang of the Sea in
the air, and the mewing of sea-birds.</p>

<p>And it was bright there, with the glow of early evenings or
of late nights; the sky ended in a pale band over the Sea, of
rose and violet wherein the stars were drowned. The Sea was
still, with expectancy, and the light of the sky shone off it
green as copper. The land down to the Sea was covered with long
dark grasses, bowing to the Sea, down to the cobbles of the
surf.</p>

<p>The man nestled the body of the woman down into the grass. He
straightened her coat, her breeches, and her braided hair. He
wiped a bit of dirt off her cheek, and stroked her dry, cold
brow, and murmured, ‘Agatha…’</p>

<h2><a name="ch29"></a>29. Of the Grianan</h2>

<p class="first">ON THE FAR SIDE of the hill Master Aengus found
a little hut built above the Sea. He rapped on the door with a
stick.</p>

<p>‘Who’s there?’ was asked.</p>

<p>‘Someone is hurt,’ said he.</p>

<p>An old fishwife peered out of the dark door. She was offering
him no pleasant failte. But looking him up and down, she
grumbled, ‘You look well enough.’</p>

<p>‘It’s not me who’s needing your help. It’s my lady,
lying yonder on the hill. Please, can you not help us?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, very well then,’ she said, none too surely. Drawing
on a shawl she followed him up the sands.</p>

<p>For a long while the woman looked over the fallen Agatha, and
she said never a word. Then she fixed Aengus with her eye.</p>

<p>‘Bring her along,’ she said.</p>

<p>Light and yielding was the girl in his arms. The rising
sea-breeze caught at the stray hairs escaping from her braid,
about the nape of her neck. Her cheek was so pale it was blue.
It was strange not to hear her coughing.</p>

<p>The crone bade him place his lady on the hut’s one cot,
covered over with dried sea weeds. How did this come to be, she
was asking him.</p>

<p>‘It fell out on the journey,’ he told her. ‘I don’t
know the tale of it too well. She was hurt.’</p>

<p>‘She is dying.’</p>

<p>The old fishwife paced round her cauldron where it hung on a
chain, and round the dark embers of the fire. ‘I am old and
weak,’ she was muttering, ‘What do you want of me? I cannot
save her. No one can.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said Master Aengus.</p>

<p>Not a tear, not a solitary tear, did Master Aengus shed. He
only was nodding his head. All his life he’d been seeking
wisdom, ever since his seventh year, when a beautiful lady had
taught him the Moon’s first name. Now he knew that Sorrow was
her name.</p>

<p>He picked up Agatha’s chill hand and placed it over her
breast. He turned and left the hut.</p>

<p class="break">THE OLD WOMAN went out of her hut after a time.
Down the beach she found him sitting on a rock, looking at the
waves.</p>

<p>The waves came and went and came again, eternally, and it was
not hard to see what way his thoughts ran.</p>

<p>‘It’s sorry I am,’ said the fishwife, ‘for my
rudeness. But it was plain truth I spoke.’ It might have been
a stone she spoke to, he was answering her so little.</p>

<p>‘I’m Grain,’ said she. ‘People come to me when
there’s nowhere else for them to go. I can help in little
things. Sometimes in large things, too. But I cannot save your
lady. Maybe,’ she was adding, after a bit, ‘maybe you
can.’</p>

<p>His head turned, slowly, and his eyes looked over his
shoulder to her.</p>

<p>‘Bring back the Sun, Master Aengus. It’s brightness and
warmth your lady is needing now. In this Night she’ll die as
sure as grass is green.’</p>

<p>He bent his head.</p>

<p>‘I can’t bring back the Sun.’</p>

<p>‘If it isn’t yourself, then no one can.’</p>

<p>‘Once before,’ he said, ‘I tried. That was near the
death of me then, and look on me now! The half of what I did
before would be beyond me now.’</p>

<p>Old Grain nodded. She put her hand upon his shoulder. Then
she turned to leave.</p>

<p>‘Wait,’ he said. ‘Before you go, tell me how you would
have had me bring back the Sun.’</p>

<p class="break">DOWN THE COAST in a grassy inch, a stream was
curling about a little island covered with quince trees, pear
trees, and wild roses. The trees were in blossom again: it was
that mild on the skirts of the Sea. Master Aengus waded into the
smell of all that blooming, that weighted down his heart.
Dripping wet he was, climbing up the bank.</p>

<p>And he heard a singing down the way.</p>

<p>In a grassy glen a girl was sitting on a stone seat, weaving
blooms together. At her side were perched a swallow and an owl.
Her back was to Master Aengus, and for a time he stood watching
her.</p>

<p>She was wearing a white woolen kirtle, and her arms were bare
and rosy. Her hair was a cloud of black threads floating on the
breezes about her face. There was a grace in the way she held
herself, like a girl who is knowing how to dance.</p>

<p>The owl and swallow hooted and chirped and flew off into the
bushes. The girl turned of a moment, her eyes widening at the
sight of the half-wild creature across the glen. She dropped her
basket.</p>

<p>‘Stay, don’t run!’ he shouted after her. ‘I’m no
stranger, Mielusine! I am Aengus – Aengus that you knew.’</p>

<p>Mielusine peered back through the branches. She looked at the
man.</p>

<p>His eyes were wild and yellowed, his cheeks cut, hair dirty
and tangled, beard bushy, clothes feathered and ragged, hands
blackened, feet bare, nails but broken talons. Still, it had the
look of him, somehow.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said he. ‘It’s myself you rescued from the
abbey.’</p>

<p>‘And Agatha?’</p>

<p>‘In a hut kept by an old woman on the strand. She’s
resting, but is ill.’</p>

<p>‘Cannot Grain be helping her?’</p>

<p>He looked away. ‘What do you do here?’</p>

<p>‘Grain gave me this orchard to tend. Here I’m growing
flowers and tending to the trees. Women come to me wanting
Grain’s help, and I give them dried flowers, and baskets of
red fruit to entice their sweethearts. And when they win them,
then they are blood-wed, as they say, though their marriage may
be lasting a life, a year, or a moon.’</p>

<p>Then they sat on the seat, and spoke for a time about this
and that.</p>

<p>‘I only wanted to know,’ he told her, ‘the mystery of
love.’</p>

<p>‘When you know the mystery, you have no love,’ she
said.</p>

<p>‘I only wanted to master it: when I loved, whom and how
much.’</p>

<p>‘When you have mastery, you have no love,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘I only wanted forgiveness, for the wrong I did her.’</p>

<p>‘When you ask forgiveness for your passion, you have no
love,’ she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her. ‘Did Agatha tell you this?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, it’s not what she knows,’ said the dancer in
answer. ‘My bare body told me this, when Vasquez touched
it.’ She reddened, as though for shame; turned her face away.
After a bit she was asking, ‘And you now, Master Aengus: she
brought back your memory?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said he.</p>

<p>‘And now she is dying. Is there nothing to be done?’</p>

<p>‘Only Day might cure her. I must go down the well by the
dun.’</p>

<p>The dancer shuddered. ‘It’s a horrible place.’</p>

<p>‘Will you help me? Can you?’</p>

<p>‘I might. But Master Aengus, yourself you are half starved.
Have you strength enough to wake the Sun?’</p>

<p>He lifted his hands, and the ragged sleeves fell away from
his wrists, showing the dark thin lines of his blood. Across the
one wrist was the crescent of a scar, faded and tired. ‘I have
all of this,’ he was saying, ‘and nought else.’</p>

<p>Mielusine was for a long time still. ‘You’re not like
Agatha told me,’ she said at last. ‘If I said I’d followed
you, and that I took the mask from the place where Agatha hid
it, and that I have it still: what would you ask me?’</p>

<p>‘The White Hind is dead,’ he answered. ‘She died bloody
murdered on my lap, a hundred and one moons ago.’ He looked on
her. His eyes were hard. ‘You have the mask?’</p>

<p>‘It’s what I told you. Shall I don it?’</p>

<p>‘Do you want to?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I’m asking, is all.’</p>

<p>He answered, ‘Mielusine, Agatha is my lady. But if you wear
the mask I will fall in love with you again, and stay here with
you always, or go, if I go, only at your bidding.’</p>

<p>‘Then you wouldn’t be going into the dry well and braving
its perils to bring back Day?’</p>

<p>‘Only if you asked it of me.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered, ‘I do not believe you, Master
Aengus. You are a part of Agatha, and she is part of you.’</p>

<p>She was so serene that he said, ‘I might have loved you had
I known you. You are like some earthly goddess now, and worthy
of all Lady Agatha’s teachings, the way you have gone past
them all.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ she said, ‘I’m only a dancer. But I can help
you, I think, a little, with this.’</p>

<p>Out of her pocket she drew the leag lorgmhar, smooth and
rounded as a hen’s egg.</p>

<h2><a name="ch30"></a> 30. Of Aengus in the Sea</h2>

<p class="first">OVER THE SEA was a bluff, driven up by thick
slabs of stone; and the waves foamed over those rocks, and gulls
and rooks wheeled in those airs. A pile of rubble stood on the
bluff. Once it was a strong man’s dun. Folk said the Druids
built it before the first grass grew.</p>

<p>Before its gates the well was sunk.</p>

<p>It was dry, that well, a low circle of the same gray stones,
bleached by the casts of birds. Deep in the well the stones were
black as hearthstones. And in the brightness of that county,
with the sky bright on the glassy sea, Master Aengus looked down
into the well. Dark and black it was. He thought he saw a little
light far down in it flickering, like a candle. But there was no
sight of the beast.</p>

<p>Aengus let down into the darkness a ladder of rope. ‘Are
you ready?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Grain held a lantern in her hand. Mielusine was cloaked with
a red mantle against the sea-breeze. The dancer nodded.</p>

<p>‘Och, my heart trembles for the two of you,’ muttered the
old woman. ‘Are you sure you’ve taken all measures?’</p>

<p>Half was he swallowed up beneath the stones. Ghastly pale was
his face in the lantern light; and his jaw was set.</p>

<p>‘I will do it,’ he told her.</p>

<p>The fishwife pressed into his palm a bit of trefoil.</p>

<p>‘If it’s hot you’re feeling, eat a stalk of this. But
save enough for coming back.’ He closed his fist about the
green.</p>

<p>And she was handing over to him the lantern, and he was going
down into the well. Mielusine went after, bearing a basket of
quinces.</p>

<p>Grain’s face shrank with the closing of the mouth of the
well above them, but the moaning of wind was growing.</p>

<p>Deep down in the well the ladder ended, but that was near
enough the bottom so they could climb down the rest of the way.
The sides of the well were rough stone, hard gravel, and broken
bits of pottery. It was dry as bone.</p>

<p>‘Aengus,’ whispered the dancer, ‘I’m afraid for
you.’</p>

<p>Before them a tunnel led down into the earth. They followed
it in silence, to where the tunnel widened, showing three dark,
gaping mouths.</p>

<p>And stretched out before the three openings was a thing as
big as a horse and white as dead bones: Henwen, the monstrous
sow of men’s nightmares and fears.</p>

<p>Such a thing you never have seen in life. Her jaws could have
gulped down a man’s head. Two of the cave mouths she lay
across, growling, her breath rough as yew-bark. Directly the two
entered her cave she started up and snarled and snapped at them.
But Mielusine scattered quinces before her, and held out in her
hand the white stone.</p>

<p>The huge sow snorted at the fruit, but she licked at
Mielusine’s hand, and nibbled daintily at the quinces.</p>

<p>‘Do you see, Master Aengus?’ said Mielusine, patting
Henwen’s great bobbing head. ‘She’s just hungry, after
all, half-starved for love.’</p>

<p>But Master Aengus was already stealing down the tunnel Grain
had told him of, moving swiftly in the black and brightness,
catching and feeling the walls close around him.</p>

<p>Mielusine took the lantern and went back up the ladder. She
and Grain rolled it up and carried it away.</p>

<p>The small, dark shapes of the two women walked slowly down
the broad beach under the weight of the bright clouds in the
sky, back to the hut.</p>

<p>Mielusine glanced back. ‘Who is that,’ she asked,
‘standing over the well?’</p>

<p>‘Where?’ asked Grain. The old woman shaded her eyes
against the gleam of the waves and squinted. ‘Ah, but my dim
eyes can hardly see a thing in all this gloom.’</p>

<p>‘He is standing over the well,’ answered the maid. ‘A
tall, thin man hidden in a tricorn and a dark gray cóta
mór.’</p>

<p>‘Could it be our Aengus?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered the Maid, ‘no, but it seems I know the
fellow.’</p>

<p>Fergus, the dark man, watched the women pass. When the coast
was clear, he stepped up to the well, and peered deep down
inside.</p>

<p class="break">IN THE HUT it was dark but for the dim glow of
the embers. Mielusine and the old fishwife crouched over the
cot, tending to the dying woman. From outside the hut came the
sounds of wind and rising waves.</p>

<p>‘She is weaker now,’ said Grain. ‘She has been unwell
that long a time.’</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t have left them,’ said Mielusine.</p>

<p>All at once a great crash sounded from without, and the sod
roof shook.</p>

<p>‘What wave is it?’ cried Mielusine, covering Agatha with
her body.</p>

<p>Grain answered in a hushed voice: ‘He is there.’</p>

<p>The dancer rose, and catching her skirts round her legs with
her hands, stepped outside the hut.</p>

<p>Agatha moaned, and twisted in her place. Grain had taken off
the damp, mouldy shirt and breeches, ragged from the thorns of
the wood, and dressed her in one of Mielusine’s shifts, and
covered her with blankets. The old woman took a bit of straw,
lit it off the embers and held it over the bed.</p>

<p>Agatha’s face was pale and flushed by turns, and the sweat
standing on her brow, and her teeth chattering with cold, in
spite of all the blankets covering her.</p>

<p>Then the straw burnt out, and shadows swallowed up the sight
of her.</p>

<p class="break">OUT ON THE SANDS the dancer twirled her skirts
with her hand. She stopped on the cobbles of rocks above the
wrinkling lace hem of the waves.</p>

<p>‘Hello, Mr Vasquez,’ she said.</p>

<p>The dark man standing at the well-side bowed to her with an
ironic flourish.</p>

<p>‘Will you dance for me, Maid Snowflake?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ she answered, ‘I’ll do that, Mr Vasquez,
after we talk a word or two.’</p>

<p>‘What is it you’d be wanting to know?’</p>

<p>‘Why you’re here, and why you wear the mask you wear, and
who you were, and who you are, and where it is you’re going,
Mr Vasquez,’ she answered him.</p>

<p>He laughed, and ran his fingers over the fabric of the mask.
‘It’s not so much,’ he said, ‘you’re asking.’</p>

<p class="break">‘THERE WAS A PIECE of the Sun,’ said the
fishwife, sitting rocking over the lady in the darkened hut.
‘It was the very heart of the Sun, to tell by the heat of it.
It fell into the Sea yonder; for the longest time we lay buried
by mist singing up out of the boiling sea; lobsters and crabs
were tossed up cooked onto the cobbles and sand.</p>

<p>‘In time it cleared,’ she sang, soft and gentle like.
‘And some of the boys went out onto the water, to see what
they could see. They dove into the deep. But only darkness was
there, and a black heat rising from the seabed. The way we knew
it had gone into the Earth, swallowed up forever. But later, in
the darkness, we were seeing strange lights flashing out of the
well up by the old dun.’</p>

<p>And another crash sounded from outside the hut, like a
fearsome wave tearing round all the coasts of the Innis
Fodhla.</p>

<p>A wind tore through the cracks of the hut, and the fire in
the embers roused and sprang up.</p>

<p>Agatha’s dim lips opened, and she breathed,
‘Aengus…’</p>

<p>‘He has found it,’ whispered Grain.</p>

<p class="break">THE WARM WET SPUME was draining away from
Vasquez’ dark gray cóta mór, and Mielusine felt her gown
clinging to her through the wet. In spite of the fearsomeness of
the wave, he by his singing, and she by the quickness of her
feet and the weight of the white stone, had held off being
washed out into the deep.</p>

<p>‘Tell me then, and tell me true,’ said the dancer.</p>

<p>He answered, ‘Well, and I will.’ He held up his hand,
considering; and it was plain that his thoughts went into the
past and he was forgetting the well and what Master Aengus did
there; and that was just what the dancer was desiring.</p>

<p>‘Once of a time,’ said the dark man, ‘old Tadgh and
Maille May were visited: that fell out on an evening just at the
moment the first stars come forth. A woman and a man, wrapped up
in their cóta mór, shawls, mufflers, bonnets and hats, asked
the cottagers if they hadn’t a boy, a <i>dark</i> lad, living
with them? And they went on and told the shape of your Aengus,
Maid Snowflake, to the last feature and trait. Tadgh and Maille
May looked each other in the eye, and didn’t know what to say.
When Aengus himself, a tall lanky boy, appeared in the doorway
next to them. And it was just his seventh birthday, or near it,
if you trust what the calendar says.</p>

<p>‘Then the strange couple were much relieved,’ said
Vasquez, ‘and they told how they had heard such good things of
the cottagers, and they said that they were the best of parents,
“and we have here a lovely child,” they went on, “and we
know of nobody who’d be better at raising it than
yourselves,” and they handed over to them another boy. Of
course, old Tadgh and Maille May fell in love with the child
from the start, and raised it after Aengus, and those two got on
so well together, that in after years they were swearing blood
brotherhood, and sharing all the secrets in each other’s
hearts, and went under the sod as one, and were of the same mind
in all things; all things, that is, save for one. And it was
said the second boy was a Tinker’s child, the way he was dark,
with a red, red lip, and I know the tale well, having heard it
enough, the way the child was myself.’</p>

<p>‘Go on,’ said the dancer, ‘if you please, and tell me
all of it, Mr Vasquez. It will do you good.’</p>

<p>So the dark man took up his tale again, and all the while,
unbeknownst to himself, he was speaking his words in a rhythm
like chanting, and moving his feet to the swaying of her hands
and hips, the way indeed the very waves out of the Sea were
starting to do.</p>

<p class="break">‘FAR AND WIDE,’ said Grain over the
shivering, dreaming lady in the cot, ‘we were sending, to find
one to go down there and heal the Sun’s heart, the way she’d
be rising again. But the few daring enough to try never
returned. They were longing for Day; but it’s only a true
child of the Night could be winning there.’</p>

<p>‘Aengus, beware!’ hissed the lady in her dream.</p>

<p>The old woman took her hand and lightly stroked it.</p>

<p>‘Agatha,’ she said, ‘what are you dreaming? Tell me
what you’re seeing, Agatha, the way my eyes are blind to it,
and I cannot see it at all!’</p>

<p>‘The tunnel,’ muttered Agatha in her dream. A fit of
coughing took her, so that for a time she was too weak to speak,
and her hand closed tight and cold in Grain’s, like one who
has been drawn up drowned out of the deep.</p>

<p>‘He is stealing down the tunnel,’ whispered Agatha. Her
eyes were still shut, and it was her dream she was telling the
fishwife. ‘The darkness is burning with growing flames, and
winds are beating up out of the deeps of the tunnel. The streams
of fire are pouring round him, but he is unburned…’</p>

<p>…And deep underground, under the bed of the Sea, in the
deep cave, Aengus paused, the way he was feeling her thought on
him and her heart beating along with his.</p>

<p>The fire was burning, breathing, roaring all round. The stone
walls glowed red and white and blue with the heat of those
fires. Nothing human could have lived there; but Aengus stood
against it, armored in the last of his art, and he pushed on
forward again, and fought and battled down into the breath of
pure fire.</p>

<p>Deeper and deeper he walked, bending his head low against the
fire, beating it away from him with his arms; his shoes burnt
black in the flames, and the iron buckles of his shoes melted
away; and even Aengus had to pause.</p>

<p>In the calm little hut by the seashore the girl in the cot
turned and tore.</p>

<p>‘He has eaten the first stalk of the green, and feels cool
now in the oven! And he is staggering farther down, and the
flames are red hot beating against him. He is falling!’</p>

<p>…Deep under the Sea, in the pits of the Earth, Aengus fell
with his hands before him onto the hot fiery floor of the cave.
His coat burned clean off him, and his hair waved and flashed in
the fire, and the sweat off his brow boiled off his dark skin
where it gleamed like a mirror of diamond and iron.</p>

<p>And the breath that went in by his mouth was all fire, and
flames were turning in his lungs, and fire was going up and down
his blood with the air that went into his lungs. It was near
boiling, Aengus’ blood; it was near catching fire and bursting
out from his veins and tearing him apart still living.</p>

<p>Aengus looked up, and saw down before him the end of the
cave, and the entrance in fire to the Chamber that lay
beyond.</p>

<p>In the calm little hut by the seashore the girl in the cot
turned and tore.</p>

<p>‘Girl, girl!’ breathed the old woman. ‘It’s on fire
you are, you’re all burning up!’</p>

<p>‘But on the ground he eats the second stalk, and he is
managing to rise to his feet again. His body is black with soot,
and the flames are bright yellow, tearing at him, battering
him.</p>

<p>‘And the flames are white, and the tunnel walls lost in
brightness. Aengus is standing as if over the edge of a white
blind cliff. The heat growing in him, and he with but the one
stalk clutched between his fingers, and it the smallest of the
three.’</p>

<p>Grain took a wet cloth, and she laid up along the girl’s
brow, and the heat there made the cloth bubble and steam.</p>

<p>…And Aengus where he stood in the entrance to the Chamber
felt a soothing coolness on his brow, the way the girl was
taking some of the hot breath of the fire away off from him.</p>

<p>And he pushed against the flames, and shoved into the
fire.</p>

<p>Inside the Chamber it was hotter still, the hottest yet, and
the flame was like pure light, like the heart out of the Sun,
and so vast was that Chamber, that its walls all fell away, and
Aengus stood on the brink of a space that seemed unending,
broader than the sky, deeper than Day.</p>

<p>Aengus squeezed his eyes against the pure hotness of heat,
and he tried to see with his eyes deeper against the light that
roared and shot and streamed out against him.</p>

<p>And it was like he trod on light itself, the way the
brightness of the hot was all around him, and under and over
him. And it was so bright his shadow fled away from there.</p>

<p>In the calm little hut by the seashore the girl in the cot
turned and tore.</p>

<p>‘Waves of light are swirling up, rising round and round.
It’s like music they are, the beating coils of light. But the
music is flawed. There is the slightest break in it, like a
halting of breath.</p>

<p>‘Aengus! Aengus! Do not go so near it!’</p>

<p class="break">WINDS were tearing off the waves, casting spray
like rain across the face of Mielusine and the mask of
Vasquez.</p>

<p>‘Tell me more, Mr Vasquez. Tell me all.’</p>

<p>‘Out of exile in a far land, when this Night fell, I came
back into Ireland,’ he answered, and his words were reft out
of his throat as though against his wishes. ‘And I hunted him,
who’d killed my love, and left my foster parents to die in the
ripeness of their age, and he looking still so young when I,
born on the same year as the calendar tells, wore the face of a
man twenty years older – thirty years older, forty or more!
And I took up his bow and arrow, and took to trailing him across
the fields of the Night.’</p>

<p>‘To kill him?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Nay, now! What man can kill the devil? But I know his love
as well as he’d known mine. She was the very spirit and joy
and romance and deep delight of the Night, was the White Hind: I
knew she’d be about him where he was, watching after him,
though never showing herself, for fear of the curse was lying
between them. In the abbey I had to take pains, the way the old
Man of the Bog was there before me, and he’d know me – so I
put on this mask and kept myself out of the way of him. And in
time you nicely took Aengus away out of the abbey, away out of
safety. And when he lay dreaming, now,’ he said with a laugh,
‘and all alone, the White Hind couldn’t help herself, and
went down to him, and gave me such a clear shot, now!’</p>

<p>‘You didn’t!’ cried Mielusine.</p>

<p>‘I did, and she’s dead!’ shouted the man.</p>

<p>At once she stopped, still as death herself: and he had to
stop, and all the face of the Sea, like a painting, or a carving
on a cathedral door, had to stop, all stop, for one moment: then
the heart in her took up beating again, Mielusine breathed,
stepped, swung her arm, and all the rest fell back in step with
her.</p>

<p>‘Now he’s out there, the doomed devil,’ said Vasquez,
just as though he wasn’t aware of the death of the moment that
had passed over him. He stretched forth a hand to her.</p>

<p>‘Come with me now,’ he beckoned, ‘Maid Snowflake, come
with me up to the dun, and we’ll stop up the mouth of the well
with hand-small stones, so Aengus has no way out.’</p>

<p>‘Come with me instead, Mr Vasquez,’ she called, and
danced out of his reach down along the waves. Her bright eyes
were stormy as the waves, and she was dancing him after her, and
dancing the waves up too, higher and deeper over their heads.</p>

<p>She was seeing, but he was not, that they two were no more
alone in the Sea’s edge in the storm. There was another there,
and it bore the likeness of a man’s shadow standing at the
edge of the sand.</p>

<p>Mielusine gestured, and the man stepped into the waves.</p>

<p>‘Show me your face, Mr Vasquez,’ she called.</p>

<p>And she danced back, and he trod a step after her.</p>

<p>‘Show me your face, and the grimness of it, Mr
Vasquez.’</p>

<p>He reached for her, she danced away, and helpless, he
staggered after her.</p>

<p>‘You should have been sleeping, Mr Vasquez. You are the Man
Who Should Have Slept – aren’t you, Mr Vasquez?’</p>

<p>Mielusine waved her hands, and the shadow stepped up behind
Fergus in the waves.</p>

<p>‘Stop, come back,’ groaned Fergus, but she only danced on
farther afield.</p>

<p>‘You should have been dreaming, Mr Vasquez,’ she called.
‘Look at your face now, shame on you! Can you stop dreaming
and stop from going mad, Mr Vasquez? Ah, but your face is
telling me another tale, Mr Vasquez!’</p>

<p>She reached out her hands, dancing back deeper under the
waves. And he, helplessly stumbling after, followed step for
step.</p>

<p>Until the shadow behind him could reach him, and locked up
both his arms in his grasp.</p>

<p class="break">IN THE FAR CORNER of the hut Grain was
huddling, hiding. She was covering her face with her shawl, and
muttering prayers in a tongue long forgotten upon the face of
the world. But out of her prayer she was asking, in spite of
herself,</p>

<p>‘Tell me what you’re seeing, Agatha. Tell me, the way my
eyes are blind to it, and I cannot see it at all!’</p>

<p>In the calm little hut by the seashore the girl in the cot
turned and tore.</p>

<p>‘He is standing over it! It is on the floor between his
feet, the root of the flaw in the light!’</p>

<p>…Up and down, round and round about Aengus, the pure light
of the heart of heat and of all things hot danced and swirled,
round and round with the beat of Maid Mielusine’s wild dance
above, back in the world that we know, in the dark of the end of
the unending Night.</p>

<p>And Aengus reached, and it seemed to him he held something
struggling in his arms.</p>

<p>But not all evenly, nor all cleanly, did the hotness swirl;
but there and here Aengus could discern a little flaw, and a
break in it, like a gasp, or the snag of a sleeve on a sliver of
wood in a rough plank.</p>

<p>And somehow Aengus could not find the source of that break,
until all at once, as if the girl’s words rang out in his ear,
he looked down between his feet.</p>

<p>And he saw it there.</p>

<p>In the calm little hut by the seashore the girl in the cot
turned and tore.</p>

<p>‘Small it is, dark and round, the size of a man’s brains,
and the white flames bending round it.</p>

<p>‘Aengus, do not – ah! He has it in his hands, he is
picking it up!’</p>

<p>…Against all the strength and the madness of the light,
against all the evil of it bending and bearing up over and
against him, its very enemy, Aengus bent low, and he drove and
strained, and managed to bring his arms down, and shove his
hands deeper into the heart of all that hotness, to the thing
that lay buried there.</p>

<p>With a great will, Aengus was bending his fingers and
clamping them round that thing, and he was pulling and tearing
at it with a heart and a half, until it began to break free.
Then it was with twice the effort in his heart, Aengus strove
with the thing, and now all at once it was as if the pure
hotness of that heat knew what he was about, and it came to his
aid, or he would never have done the thing, not even Aengus, not
even himself.</p>

<p>And all at once the thing tore free; Aengus staggered
backward in the light, and the pure hotness of heat throbbed and
thundered through the unending space of that pit.</p>

<p>‘And now the music of the light is restored. And fiercer
it’s growing, and awful beyond denial.’</p>

<p>…Back Aengus staggered, and he was finding himself at the
entrance to the Chamber once more, and fighting his way back up
the cave with the fire tearing and shooting at his back, twice
as hot, thrice as fearsome, four times as evil. And it hit
against him in the back of him, and threw him forward and down
on his face.</p>

<p>And the thing in his arms tore free of his grasp.</p>

<p class="break">THE STORM rose up in a great tower over their
heads, and Mielusine danced across the waves, a wild and
dangerous dance. Fergus tore himself free, and turned to face
the shadow. The face of Fergus went all white, and Mielusine
laughed.</p>

<p>‘Aengus! You!’ shouted Fergus. And he swept out their
father’s sword.</p>

<p>But the shadow dipt its hand in the sea, and sent bits of
salt scattering into his brother’s eyes, and it leapt forward
and caught Fergus’ wrists in the lock of its fingers. And for
a time they were struggling there, and the great waves throbbed
and thundered about them both beneath the dancing feet of the
girl.</p>

<p>Fergus threw the shadow back, and went for him; but the
stroke of the sword went past the twisting shadow, and cut only
brine instead of flesh; the shadow rammed into Fergus’ chest,
and the sword broke out of Fergus’ hand and dropped into the
Sea.</p>

<p>Under the Sea swam the shadow, and Fergus after it, and the
great waves roiling the sand and stones of the shore up and
about them. Deeper the shadow dove, and Fergus after it, down to
the bottom where the sea-bed glowed red and orange from the heat
of the fires of the heart of the Sun below.</p>

<p class="break">IN THE CALM LITTLE HUT by the seashore the girl
in the cot turned and tore.</p>

<p>‘But no! he’s eaten the last stalk, and manages to hold
his footing. But it was the last!’</p>

<p>…All the cave filled with fire; it tilted and it spun.
Aengus was pitched backward as though he were swimming down,
down toward the mouth of the Chamber where the new-wakened Sun
was growing and bursting like fifty kegs full of gunpowder and
pitch.</p>

<p>The Sun growled, and groaned, and roared out, <i>Awake, Awake
again!</i></p>

<p>But in the calm little hut by the seashore the girl in the
cot turned her fingers upon the rough planks of the cot, and her
nails tore and dug into the cracks in the wood.</p>

<p>…And Aengus turned his fingers upon the stone of the cave,
and his nails tore and dug into the cracks in the stone. And he
held on, and did not fall back into the mouth of the Sun.</p>

<p>Slowly Aengus went now, slower and slower his feet and his
hands were gripping and pushing back the stone.</p>

<p>Something was calling him. Some voice was calling out his
name from the back of him, deep in the Chamber of the heart of
the Sun. And it was a dire duty in his heart to be turning and
looking back and beholding the source of that voice.</p>

<p>‘Go on, go on! Don’t be halting, don’t look back! What
are you listening to? What words are you hearing breathed upon
the fire?’</p>

<p>…He lowered his head, and he was starting to look back; and
all at once the cave twisted and spun like a wild pony; there
was no standing or holding on to it then.</p>

<p>‘Tell me what you’re seeing, Agatha. Tell me, the way my
eyes are blind to it, and I cannot see it at all!’</p>

<p>But then the crash sounded from without the hut, and it shook
the Earth.</p>

<p class="break">DEEP UNDER THE WAVES Fergus swam, and he saw
his father’s sword half-buried in the sand; he reached out his
hand for it.</p>

<p>But the hand of the shadow flashed there before Fergus’
hand, and it was the shadow gripped the sword, and turned it and
stabbed it, deep in the black heart of Angus’ brother.</p>

<p>But then the crash sounded from above, and it shook the
Earth. The third great wave of Ireland broke on all the coasts,
and bluffs fell into waters, and stones shattered in foam, and
vast bites of beaches were swallowed into gray-green waters.
Grain shrieked: Agatha’s body shook and went lifeless and limp
in that last of all moments.</p>

<p>And the shore to the grianan was the hardest hit; and the
peak of the wave smashed into the little hut, breaking its walls
and toppling its chimney and burying all within.</p>

<p>And the third wave ripped away the dead bones of the dark
man, the Man Who Should Have Slept, with the sword still
sticking out of it, and the dancer laughed a wild laugh and
danced up on the white spume of the wave, all the way up to the
headland over the dun, where she lighted down nimble as a
sea-bird on the wild grass blades.</p>

<p>She turned, wet through and drenched, her white dress
clinging to her, her black hair streaming wet and wild down her
back, and her lips red as Arianna’s cloaks.</p>

<p>‘Take him away across the Sea, my wave!’ she sang, still
dancing and showing the leag lorgmhar. ‘Take him away back to
his place, and let him be happy there, and wash away out of his
heart all the evil robbing his peace and his contentment!’</p>

<p>And the while she was dancing, the wave was rolling away,
away across the Sea, until it rolled over the far horizon.</p>

<p class="break">BUT WITHIN THE CAVE beneath the Sea it was
quiet for that moment. Huddled on the sooty ground, Master
Aengus loosened his grasp of the sword hilt that he felt but
might not see. And the feeling of waves over his back left him,
and he raised his head.</p>

<p>He found that he had fallen in the cave of fire, and soon the
winds were swirling up again out of the deeps. But he saw, too,
that the shock of the wave had cast him up out of the reach of
the flames, and around him was only light.</p>

<p>No more than light glancing up the tunnel walls, and he lying
on the cool floor, his eyes open and staring, his lungs sucking
in the unburnt air in sobs.</p>

<p>Later he was rising to his feet, and picking up the stone. He
climbed the last reach of the tunnel, past the sleeping Henwen
and up the well-wall, easily. The clouds in the sky were
breaking, and the wave falling away out into the glassy deeps of
the Sea, its mother. The stars were peeping down on Ireland, and
a rosy light was shining, of the moonrise.</p>

<p>Master Aengus laughed, the way he knew he’d won. And he
knelt and touched his brow, and prayed out his thanks to the
Moon aloud.</p>

<p>But that was ill done.</p>

<h3>The End of the Seventh Year of Night</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the end of the seventh year of that
Night, the Earth shuddered underfoot. There was a pause – a
breath was taken and held.</i></p>

<p><i>All the Waking felt it, those with Power and those
without. They all wondered what it might portend. And when the
burning blinding Brightness came, they shut their eyes and
turned their faces away.</i></p>

<p><i>They didn’t know what it could mean. They had forgotten
Day. They had forgotten Sun. Only at the end of the first hour
of the Dawn did the memories flood back to them.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch31"></a> 31. Of the Lady’s Share</h2>

<p class="first">IN THE PALE LIGHT, in the calm after the great
storm of the wave, in the cool after the burning of the Sun’s
bright heart, Master Aengus walks along the strand. His path is
not straight, but is weaving here and there between the pits
eaten out of the strand by the third wave.</p>

<p>He is looking at this shell, and circling that stone, and he
is breathing in the wet salt air, and hearing the songs of the
morgans in the waves. There is a sort of drunkenness in him,
light and breathless, and his eyes look on the face of the world
with the wonder of a child. And so bright is he shining, that he
is casting no shadow on the bosom of the Earth.</p>

<p>In the wreckage down the way, two figures were standing. It
was only after a time that Aengus was aware of them.</p>

<p>The smaller he knew, and the name of her he knew, and that
was Grain. The other was taller, and of fairer form. She was a
young lady dressed in a black woolen dress such as fishwives
wore. A scarlet scarf was caught about her throat, her breast
was bare, and her hair bound about her head shone with streaks
of red gold. From that, Aengus knew she wasn’t Mielusine: nor
was she, the way the dancer was standing higher up on the
grasses by the hill. Next to her on the rocks were perched her
sister owl and swallow.</p>

<p>‘Tch, for shame, look at yourself!’ scolded old Grain.</p>

<p>He had to laugh at the sight of himself. The fires in the
cave had burnt off his tattered clothes, burnt back his hair and
burnt off his beard, and all the filthiness was burnt clean away
from him. The fire had even burnt away the scratches on his arms
and the lines in his face, as if it polished him. His skin was
pale and burning bright, and where his bare feet touched the
sand steam was rising, the way he was yet coal-hot. He hadn’t
even felt his nakedness.</p>

<p>Old Grain shooed him back, and he stumbled into the waves,
raising hissing clouds of steam. The old woman drew him back,
but he was still hot, so in he went again, and Mielusine danced
him out, and now he had his shadow back. And the third time it
was the lady in black and red that quenched him, and drew him
out by the hand.</p>

<p>Naked, shining with water, Master Aengus took Lady Agatha in
his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>‘You are younger now than ever I knew you,’ said Agatha,
holding him at the ends of her arms. ‘And even handsome!’</p>

<p>But Grain, clucking her tongue, covered him up in her shawl.
He let her do that, but his eyes were full of Agatha.</p>

<p>‘But I’m not the White Hind,’ she told him.</p>

<p>‘No,’ he answered her, ‘you are the woman I love.’</p>

<p>He said that so earnestly that she had to laugh.</p>

<p>Then he gave the old fishwife the blackened ball out of the
heart of the Sun, and she turned it over and over, looking at it
closely.</p>

<p>‘This,’ she said, ‘is no stone, but the skull of your
enemy, Master Aengus, all charred by the fire. It’s his dreams
that have been cursing you.’</p>

<p>But Master Aengus frowned. ‘Who hated me so?’</p>

<p>‘No, but I know,’ said Agatha. ‘Is it not my old
lord?’</p>

<p>‘Aye, that was the one.’</p>

<p>‘But what had he to do with me?’ Aengus wondered.</p>

<p>‘Faith, what had he not to do with you? Do you not know how
at birth you were put in his cradle, and he was taken away to
your own mother? You two were born of an hour, for all that you
came of age before him, and he was old when you were still taken
for a youth. After seven years, your mother brought him back,
and would have taken yourself away with her, only you proved
stubborn, and must stay in the world of men. Then your mother
cursed you with forgetfulness and ionarbadh, and left you as you
were.’</p>

<p>‘And he was old from my first memory of him,’ wondered
Aengus.</p>

<p>‘Not wholly was your heritage to be denied. For every year
that took its toll on him, you paid but an hour’s fee. You had
forgotten, but he was cursed with remembering, as of dreams,
those first seven years of his. As who indeed could be
forgetting marvels?</p>

<p>‘Not his fine house, his hounds, his carriages, nor his
stables pleased him, but were as tarnished gold. Why else was he
forever going off alone with his hounds? It wasn’t the fox or
the stag he was hunting for!</p>

<p>‘He was hating you with all his heart, Aengus, but you were
too innocent to see the truth of that… Is it any wonder the
both of you loved the same auburn beauty, with her eyes bright
as the moon of your home?’</p>

<p>Then Grain hummed, lightly to herself: ‘Yaaaaaa …
ai!’</p>

<p>And Mielusine brought down the leag lorgmhar and broke the
skull like an egg. Grain let the charred fragments fall to the
sand, but drew out of them a little red jewel, perfect as a
dream. She held it out behind her, and made as though to hurl it
to the waves.</p>

<p>‘Hold, now,’ said Master Aengus, frowning. ‘You still
have not told all. If old Tadgh and Maille May were not my
parents, then who were? And who was this mother of mine, of whom
you seem to know so much?’</p>

<p>‘Now, that is a question you ought not have asked,’ said
the old woman. She pointed with her cípín, fear in her eye.
‘The way you are Prince Og, and your mother is the Lady of the
Lough, and she’s coming even now to claim you.’</p>

<p>The Earth under their feet was shaking like waves, and over
the hill a hundred riders rode, resplendent in scarlet and black
cloaks and cutlasses. Behind them was a coach drawn by eight
white mares, and round it bounded a great pack of blood
hounds.</p>

<p>Grain shrank back. It was the look in her eyes of a gambler
wagering high, and seeing the prize almost in his grasp, only to
lose with the last card.</p>

<p>And Agatha knew then that in the last evenings of the day,
the horsemen hadn’t come for her at all. They had come for
<i>him</i>.</p>

<p>The bandits and wenches thundered around; the coach wheeled
to a halt. Arianna stepped forth. A silver fan in her hand, her
step imperious, and wrath in her eye. From the coach windows the
faces of her maids peered out.</p>

<p>Grain cowered, and Mielusine and Lady Agatha curtsied, and
even Aengus knelt on one knee in the black shawl.</p>

<p>‘You think to cheat me,’ said Arianna.</p>

<p>‘Did you think you could pray to my Moon aloud, Aengus, and
not pay me so much as a penny for a duais? Do you think this
will all end happily for you four, and badly now for me? No, but
it’s one of your lives I’ll be taking for my injuries.’</p>

<p>Then Mielusine spoke first and said, ‘These two have
suffered enough because of you. But I without my sisters am
still lost. Take me then, and let them live.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Agatha. ‘You won’t do that for him,
Mielusine. Only I should have that right. I will go with you,
Lady, and little difference it will make, the way I am near
dying anyway. But let Aengus go, and be happy.’</p>

<p>‘Neither you nor you will go,’ swore Aengus. ‘Nor
myself, either. But we will bring back the Sun and burn away
your mists, Arianna.’</p>

<p>‘I can yet forestall the Sun from rising for all that you
have done, foolish boy! Ask her, if you doubt me.’</p>

<p>And she pointed her fan towards the fishwife. Old Grain
nodded.</p>

<p>‘You tried to rob Eudemarec away from me,’ resumed the
lady. ‘Were you thinking you could take him from me without
replacing him? It’s you I’ll be taking, Master Aengus. For
you alone of all men loved me and yet did not love me well; you
loved me with your heart alone, therefore it is your heart I
will have torn in two.’</p>

<p>And she dashed down on the sand a slender chain, and on the
end of it a golden guinea.</p>

<p>‘I took this as the price of your life, Aengus. Now I’ll
buy you back.’</p>

<p>He bent and picked it up. He had to.</p>

<p>He looked on Agatha.</p>

<p>He looked on her for the last time. As if he would seal
forever the sight of her as she was in that moment: distraught,
pale from weakness and so beautiful it made his heart ache.</p>

<p>‘Lady Arianna,’ he said, ‘you called to me once, in a
hayfield in moonlight, when I was seven winters old. I turned my
back to you then, and cast aside your parentage, and held myself
to be a man, though I was never one of Adam’s sons. Then my
bride called out to me, and you cursed her and me. You took away
my memory, but now some part of it is coming back to me, in
spite of all your doing. Even so, I accept your judgment.</p>

<p>‘I will go with you,’ he said, ‘and serve you in your
abbey in the mist. But in return you will watch over Lady Agatha
as once you watched over me, and shelter her as one of your
own.’</p>

<p>Then he stepped up over the wreckage on the strand, and stood
on the sedge with Arianna. But Agatha said, ‘Wait.’</p>

<p>She drew out of her scarf a small bundle and unwrapped it. In
the nest of rags, the little jeweled snuffbox sparkled like a
gathering of stars.</p>

<p>‘I took this from you along the way,’ she said. ‘I
cannot open it. Will you be needing it?’</p>

<p>‘Mielusine will open it,’ he said.</p>

<p>The dancer took the box, and putting her fingers to it she
laid it open, easily, discovering what was within. It was a
velvet black ribbon threaded with scarlet, with a cameo of
ivory, of the face of the third night’s Moon.</p>

<p>‘Until now, I myself had never seen what was within the
box,’ said Aengus. ‘It was Mac Bride gave me that snuffbox,
upon my twenty-first birthday.’</p>

<p>‘It was herself gave it to me to give you,’ said Mac
Bride among the bandits. ‘What did I tell you then of
it?’</p>

<p>Aengus was looking at Agatha. ‘That what lay within it
would be hidden forever until I found the woman to whom I should
belong. That it was only she it would fit.’</p>

<p>Then Mielusine was clasping the necklace round Lady
Agatha’s throat, which it fit that snugly and well. Agatha put
her hand up to the velvet warming to her flesh.</p>

<p>‘She will have to watch over you now,’ said Aengus.</p>

<p>Agatha stepped forward, with a little ‘Aengus!’ on her
tongue.</p>

<p>‘Hold your place,’ said the lady. ‘You have chosen,
stay where you belong.’</p>

<p>The bandits led Master Aengus to the coach, the blood hounds
nipping at his heels. The lady stepped up after him.</p>

<p>‘Lady! Lady!’ It was Mielusine calling.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Dancer?’</p>

<p>Mielusine cast down her gaze, then looked up boldly. ‘Will
it go well with you, if I am returning to the lough?’</p>

<p>‘Were you happy there?’</p>

<p>‘I was. What will my beauty win me in Day? Riches, perhaps,
and back door acclaim, and to be called a doxy and a whore? But
in your abbey I will be a lady.’</p>

<p>‘It’s wise you’ve grown, Dancer. Very well: come into
the coach.’ Two of the jades covered Mielusine with one of the
scarlet cloaks, and it was himself, Mac Bride, held the door and
helped her up.</p>

<p>‘You must have servants if you’re to be a lady,’ said
Arianna. Mielusine looked behind her, and saw the owl and
swallow growing, and turning into her sisters.</p>

<p>‘Grisalta!’ she cried, and ‘Merrwyn!’ And the three
of them embraced, and set to telling one another tales of all
they’d been doing during the long Night.</p>

<p>But Aengus where he sat bent his head and squeezed his eyes.
‘What is it now, boy?’ asked Mac Bride.</p>

<p>‘The White Hind,’ answered the man. ‘She’s
dead.’</p>

<p>‘Is she now?’ asked the old cottager with a breath.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Mielusine, breaking from her sisters. ‘Mac
Bride, Mr Vasquez killed your daughter.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you people of Day,’ sighed Arianna. ‘Look where
I’m looking, and tell it over again.’</p>

<p>They looked up the strand, and saw a young lady walking down
to them. She was wearing a long white gown, the side of it all
reddened, and in her hand she bore an arrow.</p>

<p>Mac Bride, the old Man of the Bog, went to his daughter. But
Arianna was there before him, and she called to the lady,
‘Princess Maeve, where have you been hiding?’</p>

<p>The Princess frowned and answered, ‘It’s what I don’t
know.’ She held out the arrow. ‘I dreamed I was sleeping.’
she said, slowly, ‘for many years.’</p>

<p>‘So you were,’ said Arianna. ‘Dream again, safe from
all harm.’ She took the arrow from the lady and stepped back;
and then it wasn’t a lady at all, but a small hind standing
there, with silver horns, a collar of gold, and a white coat
streaked along one side with a doeskin colored streak.</p>

<p>The old Man of the Bog knelt beside the White Hind, took her
head in his long, lean hands, and stroked her soft white
brow.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you were wayward as a girl, when you sided with my
fosterling Prince Og. Then you were made to serve the lady in
her abbey for seven of our years; but you were wayward, wayward,
and fool that I am, I taught you the secret of the causeway, and
you ran away home again.</p>

<p>‘But for that the lady haunted and cursed you, and in your
mother’s arms you became again what you’d been when we
fostered you, a beast of hill and wood, hunted by men. Then your
mother was saddened to death over the loss of you. And I,’ he
said, ‘I hardened my heart against you, the way you were so
wayward, and the death to me of your mother. It was glad I was,
to go back into Day and watch over Aengus again from afar. But
is this truly the only way to save you now?’</p>

<p>Arianna handed Mac Bride the bloody arrow, and answered,
‘No man’s arrows could kill her, but this came from my
father, and was shot by a man who learned our secrets. It’s
the only way to be saving her now, to let her be the Hind.’</p>

<p>‘Go on then,’ he muttered into the White Hind’s ear.
‘Go on then, and trust no men with their bows and lures.’</p>

<p>The White Hind pranced away up across the grianan. Agatha and
Mac Bride and Aengus watched her go.</p>

<p>‘So that’s why you loved her,’ said Agatha. ‘You
remembered Princess Maeve, and saw her in the White Hind.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Aengus, ‘I didn’t remember her. I longed
for the Hind.’</p>

<p>‘But it’s only a story, of Princess Maeve and Prince
Og.’</p>

<p>‘All our lives are only stories, Miss,’ answered Mac
Bride, ‘when they’re told to somebody else.’</p>

<p>The coach started, and in the window Agatha saw Aengus’
face looking back to her. And she heard the words Arianna spoke
to him: ‘It was never for that world you were born, Master
Aengus. Now you are going home again.’</p>

<p>And the silver bandits mounted, and in a clopping, a
creaking, and a barking they all rode up away over the hill with
Master Aengus and Mielusine, and were gone.</p>

<p>Mac Bride only stayed behind, and held Lady Agatha to comfort
her. But she tore herself away, went down the strand and knelt
on a heap of cast up seaweed, where she bowed her head, tore the
braids out of her hair, and let the waves splash round her
skirts.</p>

<p>‘’Tis best this way,’ said Grain. ‘The way Agatha
could not have lived on in the Night; and he must be ever
hounded and hunted in Day for what he’d done.’</p>

<p>‘Yet even if they had been able to live there together,
unknown,’ answered Mac Bride, ‘with such a love as now
possesses them, they would have been friendless. Men would hate
them, women would envy them, and before long the soldiers of the
King would be marching round to tear them all asunder.’</p>

<p>Grain sighed. ‘Those who love with a true love have no
other needs, and make the worst of rebels. Only in death could
they have been united there.’</p>

<p>Then she leaned back, and flung the red gem to the waves.</p>

<p>Deep into the Sea the red gem floated, past waving bands of
weeds, under schools of flashing fish; deep into the dark the
red gem sank, into the land that was sleeping under the
waves.</p>

<p>And soon the waves quieted, and the pale band of gold and
blue brightened and spread up into the sky, pointed like the
crown of Christ or of Hercules, putting an end to Lady
Agatha’s long ionarbadh, and shining on the green, green
hills; and an intolerable brightness burst out of the Sea, and
it was dawn, and the beginning of another day.</p>

<h3>The First New Year of Sun</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In the first new year of Day, those Waking
who had no Powers, and who had been Cast Out of the Strong
Places, found themselves in the second hour of the Dawn walking
down old familiar paths again. To their old front doors. They
opened their doors and looked inside. They found their lovers,
their kin, their friends, and all the other Sleeping, stretching
in their chairs and beds and opening their eyes.</i></p>

<p><i>But the Special Ones raised their walls higher against the
Sun, and shut themselves away. They walled off the Strong Places
forever from the harsh light of the world. They clung to their
Powers and the company of their own kind.</i></p>

<p><i>The Waking shared breakfast with those who had been
Sleeping through all those Seven Years. And the Waking tried to
tell the Sleeping what they had missed, the strange lands and
unheard-of adventures of the Night of Seven Years. But the
Sleeping rubbed their eyes and yawned and said only, ‘Enough
of your dreams, now let me tell you mine.’</i></p>

<p><i>The Waking held their tongues at that, and the world went
on – as if only one night of twelve hours had passed across
the world, and not one of seven years.</i></p>

<p><i>But some of the Waking never forgot those years, and over
and over again they were telling of them, in fairy tales, and
painting of them in unworldly colors and strokes, and singing of
them with fire and too-great joy. They knew one another by what
they read and saw and heard in the new schools of art. And
though their children never knew what it was to walk and breathe
the airs of Night-Land, all the same they remembered, in their
dreams and in their blood, when ecstasy took them, when they
danced and sang, whey they heard the tales of the fantastic,
when they saw strange building and unearthly paints, what their
fathers and mothers had lived through.</i></p>

<p><i>And faintly through all the art works born of that
impulse, there ran the traces of the Strong Places and the
Special Ones, walled away from the world forever by their own
devising. Always those traces can be found with longing and a
sense of loss and regret. But they are gone to us all the
same.</i></p>

<h1><a name="after"></a> Afterword</h1>

<p class="first">ON THE MORNING of November 29, 1757, Sir James,
Dame Letitia, Lady Felicia, Miss Cecily, and Mr Humphreys woke
up in their chambers in the manor house. The servants woke as
well, and the wealthy men and their ladies enjoyed a hearty
breakfast.</p>

<p>It was a topic of some curiosity amongst them, that the lord
and his lady had deserted them in the night; but they knew the
old lord’s eccentricities, and soon enough their questions
were answered by Lady Agatha when she returned to them. She told
them the truth, that the lord had fallen in a duel over her
honor, and that the man who’d killed him, Master Aengus, had
fled their country.</p>

<p>That same morning a gruff, callused cottager woke up in his
hut, and gave three calls for his youngest.</p>

<p>‘Sini! Sini, you lazy bones, come fetch me my porridge!’
he shouted. But the rest of the cottage was empty, and the
countryman’s daughters fled away in the night. They never came
back, either, and the cottager lived on in loneliness, grumbling
at anyone addressing him, and ending his days in peevish
sourness.</p>

<p>On that morning of November 29, 1757, the world wakened, as
it always did. An unusual night seemed to have passed, the way
so many had died, and so many births were to be recorded; but it
was no great marvel, the way the odd facts seemed all to be
applying only to the poor folk, Tinkers and such like trash; and
whoever gave a Tinker’s damn for them? Governments took their
seats and began another day of taxing their nations, judging
their criminals, and sending them to gaols, prison, and hemp.</p>

<p>But the folk who had Wakened through Night into Day
remembered, and carried a little bit of the Night about with
them for the rest of their lives. And the ones who had been
<i>born</i> in the Night were gifted with dreams for ever, and
they looked on the world through eyes bred to the Night-land.
They only came alive at the falling of the day.</p>

<p>With the help of Mac Bride, Lady Agatha took over the old
lord’s estates. They hung up over the main door an arrow, and
forbade all further hunting on the estates. The rich men and
their ladies found her much altered, sad and dreamy-eyed; soon
enough even Lady Felicia lost patience with her and went to
lodge with other hosts.</p>

<p>But herself, Lady Agatha, voyaged to Italy, where for all
that winter she bathed in the Mediterranean sun. Her health was
coming back to her, but in the secret place in her back was
still the small red star, and in the spring she went back into
Ireland. On Beltane Moon, she built a Need-fire out of driftwood
on the lawn, burning all night, the way Beltane is a favoring
fire, for then the Druids had made fires with spells, driving
cattle between them against evil. And there was merriment
enacted there, and lovemaking among strangers, the way all there
wore masks.</p>

<p>And on Midsummer’s Eve Lady Agatha rode down to the shore
alone, beneath the dun at Knockadoon Head. She swam naked in the
sea, and shivered beneath nought but a shawl, waiting for the
dawn, that always came, always. And for this folly of swimming
in the Western Sea she suffered her cough to come back.</p>

<p>November Eve came, Samhain, for suain is a gentle sound, and
at Samhain gentle voices call. Lady Agatha found Mac Bride in a
riding coat, his few belongings tied in a sack.</p>

<p>‘Faith, where are you off to?’ she asked him.</p>

<p>‘It’s to Lough Mask I’m going, to the Lady of the
Lough,’ answered he.</p>

<p>‘Take me along with you.’</p>

<p>He looked at her sternly, shaking his head; it was plain he
wanted to be obliging her, only the thing she was asking was
forbidden. He said at length,</p>

<p>‘Yes. If you want it.’</p>

<p>And together in the sunset those two were riding across the
fields, leaping stiles and hedges, outracing the Sun, until they
rode over the ridge into the watery mist, that could be entered
at no other time.</p>

<p>Master Aengus waited for them there at the bottom of the
lough.</p>

<p>He had not died, but he lived as Arianna’s man in her abbey
on the lough, where an endless twilight darkened into night. The
bandits and wild ladies and the elder folk had flocked to
Arianna in the mist; second only to her was the Lady of the
Stone, the one they called the Dancer. She lived in the second
tower of the Abbey, the Bride’s Tower, that was finished at
last, with her sisters, Maid Grisalta and Maid Merrwyn.</p>

<p>And Agatha joined him in those darkling misty lands, under
the orchards, and for one night they were together, speaking
quickly, catching up on all their news. Holding each other with
all their strength, beneath a quince tree, for one night.</p>

<p>When the night was brightening into dying, Mac Bride told her
he would not leave that place again. ‘It was only to be
helping you I went back into the foreign land at all,’ he told
her.</p>

<p>Alone Lady Agatha rode over the ridge, out into the misty
dawn, and found it was not a night that had passed there in the
foreign land of the day, but a full month of the Moon.</p>

<p>In all the years after Lady Agatha was wintering in the
Italian sun, building her Beltane fire, bathing beneath
Knockadoon Head, and riding to her ghostly lover in the lough
every November Eve.</p>

<p>As the years went by, she grew older at but half the
quickness of those around her. But Master Aengus in the orchard
aged hardly at all, the way he was living in Tir-na-n’Og. Soon
enough Agatha matched him in seeming year for year, and after
that looked older. Master Aengus did grow older, a little, the
way he aged a month’s time every night she came to join him,
and he took back a little of her age, and put it on himself.</p>

<p>Even so, Master Aengus never forgot the Princess Maeve, the
White Hind. He saw her prancing in the wood in white moonlight
on Midsummer’s Eve, even as Agatha in the foreign land was
diving in the sea-foam. It is not to be thought he was so
utterly faithless as that, to be forgetting her. But he kept his
faith after his own fashion, as he did all other things.</p>

<p>Once riding to him Lady Agatha mistook the height of a stile
and was thrown from her horse and killed.</p>

<p>She was old then, but the grandchildren of her friends were
fully grown, and their children old enough to have danced their
first mask in the Need-fire light.</p>

<p>They did not bury her in the church with the rest of her kin,
but put her under Earth on her lawn, beneath where the grass was
dead and the ground bare, the way she had been building there
her Need-fires for nigh a hundred years.</p>

<p>Master Aengus waited in the watery mist below the ridge. And
when he saw she would not come, then he broke out across the
ridge and dared steal even over the fields of the foreign land,
going only by night, and hiding himself by day. He went to the
manor house, now falling in ruins, ill maintained for all
Agatha’s extravagance in keeping about her vagabond poets and
wild-souled beauties who cared for nothing at all but love and
pleasure, and only their own loves at that: were they not the
children of the Night?</p>

<p>All fallen in ruins was the manor house, and the grass grown
up wild about it, and the hedges of its mazes tall as castle
walls. It was almost fallen beyond all recognizing.</p>

<p>But Aengus knew where to go.</p>

<p>There was a little marker there. It was of wood as she had
wanted, the way it would soon be gone, burnt beneath the
driftwood of the next year’s bonfire, and the next year’s
after that.</p>

<p>Master Aengus had aged a day for every step he had taken out
of his mother’s land. He sat by the marker all the night long,
weary and breathless. Once he had stood beneath her windows
yonder, and cut a bloom from her garden, a single bud of the
night-blooming rose.</p>

<p>When the dawn broke, the Sun’s rays, marching green across
the rimy lawns, discovered not Master Aengus sitting, but only a
few moldy bones fallen beside the marker.</p>

<p>And the Sun rose, cruel and all-seeing as it ever is.</p>

<p>A young woman in a dark dress came out on the lawn. Her eyes
were light as sea-waves, and her face fair, and in her reddish
dark hair was a streak of white. She was the daughter of the
daughter of the daughter of those two, and her name was Siona
Mac Ulcin.</p>

<p>‘Bury the bones with my great-grandmother,’ she said to
the servants. ‘She told me he would come.’</p>

<p>Come October, 1858, on her way to Italy, Siona Mac Ulcin took
the stage round Ireland with one of her young men friends. She
stopped at old Connor’s stage on the way, and she told the
master there her story. Himself now was Connor’s great-great
grandson; his great granddad had been Shawn Ruadh, Siobhan’s
son; and he made Siona tell the tale out three times, until he
had it right.</p>

<p>In his turn he told it to his guests, the ones he most liked,
the way it was his best-loved tale. They stayed over to hear it
out: it took all the night to tell, and who wouldn’t have
tarried, to hear the truth of why the Sun had ceased to shine,
and to recall the feats of daring in the Night of Seven Years?
Traveler told it out to companion, and the latter told it out in
turn. So it has come in a long, long line; and now in my turn I
pass it on to you.</p>

<h5>The Naked Damsel</h5>

<p class="break">The armored men parted and the damsel stepped
forth.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said King Arthur, ‘what has brought you
here?’</p>

<p>‘This,’ she answered, and let fall the mantle to the
floor. Beneath the furs the damsel stood naked, and wore nothing
beside the black veil and a heavy sword belted over her slim
waist.</p>

<p>‘What is this sword you wear?’ asked the King. ‘Maiden,
to stand so naked with a sword ill beseems you.’</p>

<p>‘The Lady Lille of Avalon,’ she answered, ‘has made me
this scabbard and Belt of the Strange Clasp, so that the sword
may not be drawn but by the best knight in the world, of the
greatest heart and strength of arms, untouched by treachery,
tricks or villainy. And I have come to your court, O King, to
see if I may find that knight here among you…’</p>

<h5>The witch went out</h5>

<p class="break">in the snow in the night in her bare feet,
naked under her nightdress. She carried an apple and a paring
knife in a stone bowl. She set the bowl in the snow before the
Juniper Tree, took the apple and pared the red skin from the
white flesh…</p>

<p>The knife slipped and bit into the mound at the bottom of her
thumb. She licked blood from her thumb and squatted over the
bowl.</p>

<p>She sat in the snow drifting down on her hair, staring at her
red blood on the white snow.</p>

<p>‘Give me a child,’ she said. ‘Give me a child as hot as
blood and as pure as snow.’</p>

<p>And the witch slipped from her nightdress and embraced the
Juniper Tree. The branches scratched her pale bare skin, leaving
little trails of blood…</p>

<h5>‘What do you think of the stranger?’</h5>

<p class="break">‘He is nothing,’ said Gundoen. ‘Much
wreckage washes to our shores. He’ll bring us no ill-luck, if
that’s what you fear. And if he does, why then his death will
end it.’</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‘Not that.’ She wondered how much of
her dream she should tell him.</p>

<p>‘What then?’</p>

<p>‘He is … of death.’</p>

<p>Gundoen chuckled. ‘Do you believe with the Pious One?’</p>

<p>‘No. He is no more than mortal, certainly. But there is
something else.’</p>

<p>‘What?’ His voice grew concerned. ‘Hertha-Toll, what
have you seen?’</p>

<p>She looked about, leaned closer.</p>

<p>‘His eyes,’ she whispered. ‘They are the eyes of a
Madpriest.’</p>

<p>• <b>Notice</b> — For any reuse or distribution, you must

<p><i>What does “conditions can be waived” mean?</i></p>

<p>CC licenses anticipate that a licensor may want to waive
compliance with a specific condition, such as attribution.</p>

<p><i>What does “Public Domain” mean?</i></p>

<p>A work is in the public domain when it is free for use by
anyone for any purpose without restriction under copyright.</p>

<p><i>What does “Fair use” mean?</i></p>

<p>All jurisdictions allow some limited uses of copyrighted
material without permission. CC licenses do not affect the
rights of users under those copyright limitations and
exceptions, such as fair use and fair dealing where
applicable.</p>

<p><i>What are “Moral Rights”?</i></p>

<p>In addition to the right of licensors to request removal of
their name from the work when used in a derivative or collective
they don’t like, copyright laws in most jurisdictions around
the world (with the notable exception of the US except in very
limited circumstances) grant creators “moral rights” which
may provide some redress if a derivative work represents a
“derogatory treatment” of the licensor’s work.</p>

<p><i>What are “Publicity Rights”?</i></p>

<p>Publicity rights allow individuals to control how their
voice, image or likeness is used for commercial purposes in
public. If a CC-licensed work includes the voice or image of
anyone other than the licensor, a user of the work may need to
get permission from those individuals before using the work for
commercial purposes.</p>

as stated below:</p>

<p><b>a.</b> to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections;</p>

<p><b>b.</b> to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that
any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
example, a translation could be marked “The original work was
translated from English to Spanish,” or a modification could
indicate “The original work has been modified.”</p>

<p><b>c.</b> to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work
including as incorporated in Collections; and,</p>

<p><b>d.</b> to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</p>

<p><b>e.</b> For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

<p><b>i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes</b>. In those
jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License;</p>

<p><b>ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes</b>. In those
jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through

<p><b>iii. Voluntary License Schemes</b>. The Licensor waives
the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the
event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.</p>

<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include
the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>

<p><b>4. Restrictions.</b> The license granted in Section 3
above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:</p>

<p><b>a.</b> You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License
with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict
the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a
later version of this License with the same License Elements as
this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
(either this or a later license version) that contains the same
License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike
3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you
license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in
(iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you
license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the “Applicable License”),
you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a
copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy
of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that
restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of
the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted
to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;
(III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict
the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the
Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.</p>

<p><b>c.</b> If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has
been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
(“Attribution Parties”) in Licensor’s copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such
party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that
Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section
3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., “French translation of
the Work by Original Author,” or “Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author”). The credit required by
this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set
out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or
Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties.</p>

<p><b>d.</b> Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by
itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must
not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
Author’s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right
granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make
Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
Original Author’s honor and reputation, the Licensor will
waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to
enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b)
of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.</p>

<p><b>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.</b></p>

<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR
OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.</p>

<p><b>6. Limitation on Liability.</b> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p><b>7. Termination.</b></p>

<p><b>a.</b> This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,
will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.</p>

<p><b>8. Miscellaneous</b></p>

<p><b>a.</b> Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.</p>

<p><b>c.</b> If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.</p>

<p><b>d.</b> No term or provision of this License shall be
deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.</p>

<p><b>e.</b> This License constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be
bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without
the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</p>

<p><b>f.</b> The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,
the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the
Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
included in the License; this License is not intended to
restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</p>
