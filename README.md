# Bloodmoon
*Blood by Moonlight* is a fantasy novel set in 18th-century Ireland.

It chronicles the history of a single night that lasts 7 full astronomical years, and the fates and desires of the madman who invoked it, the woman for whom he did so, and other dwellers in the Night, not all of whom are human.

Duels are fought, curses made, and love inspired and betrayed, all whilst most people across the globe sleep, as though the Night lasted but a few hours. For the Wakeful, though, there are secret societies to join, bets to be waged, obsessive loves to be pursued â€¦ until the Night must end and a new Day break.
